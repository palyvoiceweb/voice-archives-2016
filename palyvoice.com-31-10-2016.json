Before the game, parents took photos and gave flowers to the girls. The team's seniors include Cummings, Pearson, Alice\u00a0Zhang, Brin Elliott, and Mayerly Grace Short.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team\u2019s last regular\u00a0season win helps seal their\u00a0undefeated record and finish the season\u00a0in first place in the ECL, giving them a chance\u00a0to the Central Coast Section (CCS) championship tournament. Only the top team from the El Camino League gets to compete in the championship tournament, which is\u00a0predominantly reserved for the De Anza League.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vikings played in the De Anza League last year before Coach Andy Harader dropped the team down. Buoyed by young talent and solid leadership, the team has enjoyed a breakout season, according to Harader. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to senior doubles player, Avery Pearson, the Vikings won with perseverance. Pearson and her doubles partner, senior Alice Zhang, clinched\u00a0the deciding match in a game that went to the third set. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLos Altos is a tough team and a lot of the matches went into a third set,\" Pearson said.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior captain Meredith Cummings acknowledged some weakness in today\u2019s game.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Today was a tough match,\u201d Cummings said. \"We played well at the baseline overall, but on my court and the others that I could see, our volleys were mainly going into the net. We needed to improve on our net play, as well as moving our feet to the ball.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the regular season over, the team has shifted its\u00a0focus to CCS. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cummings feels\u00a0that a focused exercise regimen will be\u00a0 a key aspect to winning the championship.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI have the feeling that if we train hard in practice, eat healthy, and exercise on the weekend, we will be in great shape to try and win it all,\u201d Cummings said. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Pearson feels the team needs to focus on mental stamina to win.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTo win CCS, I think we all need to be in the right mindset the day of the tournament. \u00a0Tennis is a mind game as much as it is a physical sport,\u201d Pearson said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the undefeated regular season, Harader is confident that the girls can win the league CCS championship.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe only thing keeping us from winning the championship will be ourselves this season,\u201d Harader said in September \u2014 a day before the season started. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125085\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_01232.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-125085\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_01232.jpg\" alt=\"The team's seniors (in the back) line up to take a photo with their younger counterparts.

Photo: Daniella Maydan.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<i>This is the sixth installment of Coffee Chats, where The Paly Voice gets to know staff members over a cup of coffee.<\/i>\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice sat down with new Palo Alto High School biology teacher Tara Verekyen, and discussed her interests and her journey to becoming a teacher over a medium iced coffee.\r\n\r\nWhile this is Verekyen\u2019s 7th year teaching biology, she began her academic journey with an interest in anthropology and was fascinated by evolution and the way in which organs evolve over time.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to pursue anthropology because I like having a\u00a0deeper insight into the biology behind human evolution and human origins,\" Verekyen said.\u00a0\"However, I found through volunteering as a tutor and volunteering at a museum that I enjoyed working in science education. When I graduated, I decided to put my interest of science together with my interest of teaching, and start a post-bachelor teaching program.\"\r\n\r\nVerekyen moved to the Bay Area from Arizona in search of a change, as well as a way to be closer to family. She currently enjoys working with her stepmother, AP Statistics teacher Misha Stempel, at Paly.\r\n\r\n\"It's awesome, but it's kind of crazy,\" Verekyen said. \"We [Verekyen and Stempel] drive in to work together and we wave to\u00a0each other in meetings. It's great!\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Stempel, it's great to see her stepdaughter at Paly because she is able to reconnect with her as well as reminisce about old times.\r\n\r\n\"It's just kind of cool because when she was younger and she and her sister would get out of school they would come to Paly and draw on the chalkboards,\" Stempel\u00a0said. \u00a0\"I still have those pictures they drew for me back then so having\u00a0 her here now is really cool. It's fun catching up with her and being a part of her life.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Verekyen, she appreciates\u00a0the environment at Paly\u00a0and enjoys interacting with the students.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's awesome, there is so much support here and so many great things going on on campus that I didn't see at my other schools,\u201d Verekyen said.\r\n\r\nVerekyen\u00a0believes that biology is an important class to take in high school.\r\n\r\n\"I love teaching freshman biology because I think it sets a really good foundation for what students are going to need later on in high school and in college\" Verekyen said.\r\n\r\nOther than teaching,\u00a0Verekyen enjoys traveling and advises her students to consider studying abroad when in college.\r\n\r\n\"It really gives unique perspective and helps you to see how your major connects to the world in a more authentic way,\" Verkeyen said.\r\n\r\nTo students planning on pursuing biology, Verekyen\u00a0encourages curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy advice for students that pursue biology is to find a topic that you really love and start exploring it, see how you can use that passion to solve modern day challenges or help people,\" Verekyen said. \"And question everything. Ask a lot of questions. Question it all.\"","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with Palo Alto High School Biology teacher Tara Verekyen, and discussed her interests and her journey to becoming a teacher over a medium iced coffee.","date":"2016-10-29 12:06:55","author":"Daniella Maydan","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Tara-Verekyen.jpg","categories":["Coffee chats","Features","Spotlight"],"tags":["anthropology","biology","coffee chat","freshman","freshman biology","misha stempel","new teacher","tara verekyen","Teacher"]},{"id":125001,"title":"Groundbreaking Homecoming dance is groundbreakingly average","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/28\/groundbreaking-homecoming-dance-is-groundbreakingly-average\/","content":"Palo Alto Homecoming traditions continue to be formed and broken: After a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/15\/asb-breaks-tradition-with-new-homecoming-plans\/\">historical<\/a>\u00a0dance last year, the Paly\u00a0Associated Student Body and Gunn Student Executive Council hosted the first-ever joint\u00a0Homecoming dance last Saturday. Despite the exciting intermingling between Paly and Gunn students, this year\u2019s dance was also plagued with lengthy lines, minimal food and general confusion.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dance took place in two gyms at Henry M. Gunn High School, and students were free to walk from one building to another to dance or play games such as ping pong or foosball with friends. While the buildings provided ample space, the hallway between the two had a bottleneck effect due to its small width and the large number of students constantly passing through.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real trouble, however, began outside the front door. Several lines of roughly 2,100 students wound their way down to the parking lot, blocking cars. Many students were confused\u00a0as to which\u00a0line they had to stand in, and the process took over an hour for some. According to Paly Assistant Principal Kathleen Laurence, ticket takers aimed to spend five seconds admitting each student into the dance.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe actually finished getting kids in seven minutes faster than we thought possible,\u201d Laurence said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125027\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"438\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMAG0068.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-125027\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMAG0068.jpg\" alt=\"IMAG0068\" width=\"438\" height=\"281\" \/><\/a> Students stand in a line stretching from the gym entrance into the parking lot to enter the dance. \"Waiting in line for nearly an hour ended up taking up a significant portion of the dance itself,\" senior Alix Westgaard said. Photo: Aidan Maese-Czeropski.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While long waits are understandable, administration breathalyzed every single student, which was a waste of time. An alternative would be to\u00a0breathalyze\u00a0one in five or one in 10\u00a0students, saving time and still preventing underage drinking. Furthermore, the lack of signs made it so many people were unaware if they were in line to purchase tickets or enter the dance, and administration did little to prevent students from cutting in line. Some students spent over one third of their allotted time standing in line, yet the dance was not extended.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I finally entered the gymnasium one hour after I arrived, I was eager to eat. Unfortunately, nearly all the food had been consumed\u00a0by the time I arrived, save for a bowl of colorful chips and salsa. Attendants occasionally brought out stacks of cookies or chocolate covered strawberries, and while they were delicious, they rarely lasted long. With thousands of students attending the dance,\u00a0ASB and SEC\u00a0should have expected the food to be quickly devoured and prepared accordingly.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The long lines and minimal food were partially compensated by enjoyable music and dancing: the most anticipated part of Homecoming was, as always, the dance floor. The DJ accepted student song requests and played a large variety of genres that were generally danceable. Iridescent lights and images of stars flashed across the walls, and most students were receptive to the music. Reconnecting with friends from other schools and meeting new people was both easy and encouraged, on and off the dance floor.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dance featured entertaining games, including ping pong and foosball, as well as photo booths and a caricature artist. However, these areas remained extremely crowded. Increasing the number of ping pong tables from the two present would have allowed more people to take part in the fun. Special effects such as lights and banners outside the dance room were also minimal. This itself was fine, as streamers don\u2019t necessarily entertain; however,\u00a0students were promised extra amenities in exchange for an inexpensive venue\u00a0so\u00a0the rooms felt almost bare.<\/span>\r\n\r\nPaly senior Alix Westgaard\u00a0says that while Homecoming was an enjoyable experience, it could have been planned much better.\r\n\r\n\"I think the challenge of having so many people attending the same venue needed to be addressed,\" Westgaard said. \"There wasn't enough space for all the cars picking up students and there weren't enough entrances to the dance, causing a very long line. In the future, they could\u00a0try to stagger the homecomings so they occurred on different weekends or try to find a different location for Paly's homecoming. Leaving the parking lot after the dance also took forty-five minutes.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homecoming 2016 wasn\u2019t entirely \"bad.\" But when sprinting to the food table to grab a snickerdoodle or two before they run out is one of the dance\u2019s high points, you know the night didn\u2019t live up to its potential.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"Despite the exciting intermingling between Paly and Gunn students, this year\u2019s Homecoming dance was plagued with lengthy lines, minimal food and general confusion.","date":"2016-10-28 20:57:57","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMAG0068.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","ASB","dance","groundbreaking","gunn","homecoming","joint","palo alto","paly","sec"]},{"id":125105,"title":"Editorial: The Paly Voice endorses Collins, Caswell and DiBrienza","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/27\/editorial-the-paly-voice-endorses-collins-caswell-and-dibrienza\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the upcoming election, three Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education seats will be up for grabs. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/school-board-candidates-vie-for-three-opening-seats\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five candidates<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have been competing for the opening positions, two of whom are incumbents Heidi Emberling and Melissa Baten Caswell; the newcomers include Todd Collins, Jay Blas Jacob Cabrera and Jennifer DiBrienza.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice staff and editors took time to research and evaluate the various candidates and their positions on topics ranging from the homework policy to\u00a0budget deficit and the conduct of teachers on\u00a0campus. Additionally, members of staff spent time attending forums with all five candidates present and interviewing the incumbents on current issues.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After much deliberation as a staff, The Paly Voice has decided to endorse Todd Collins, incumbent Melissa Baten Caswell and Jennifer DiBrienza.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Todd Collins: The Fiscally Responsible\u00a0Candidate<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_122806\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"272\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6355-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-122806\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6355-1.jpg\" alt=\"Todd Collins, a candidate for school board, referenced his experiences serving on various committees to voice his perspective.

While other candidates have acknowledged the issue, he has been the only one to recognize that innovation is contingent upon the availability of funds. Collins supports new pathways and programs, but doesn\u2019t consider them to be feasible given current financial conditions.\u00a0Collins not only has the financial background, but is an asset because of his attention to detail and exposure to the board's past finances via various committees.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, in keeping with his recommendations following his time on EMAC, Collins concurs with The Paly Voice staff in <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/25\/editorial-explore-other-avenues-to-counter-overcrowding\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">standing against<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the creation of new schools within the district due to declining enrollment in elementary schools the past few years.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins persistently emphasizes the need for data-driven decision making, whether it be concerning the homework policy or the continuation of the current teacher evaluation system.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins values resiliency, an integral part of the learning process, and wants to see PAUSD students \u201cexperience and overcome failure.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Melissa Baten Caswell: The Experienced Incumbent<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caswell will be completing her second term, and while outside of the norm, electing her to a third this coming November will benefit the Palo Alto community because of her extensive knowledge regarding administrative procedures. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has previously served as board president and has experience serving on various school specific Parent Teacher Association councils.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_122810\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"302\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6360-1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-122810\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6360-1.jpg\" alt=\"Melissa Baten Caswell, who has completed two terms on the school board, acknowledged areas of improvement and strengths of the current school board.

As students we benefit from inventive programs, many of which have been implemented during her time on the board. Flipped classrooms, blended learning and programs such as Social Justice and Advanced Authentic Research allow for individualized learning experiences, enhancing our development as 21st century learners.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caswell displays some of the best features of the current board. She not only recognizes its shortcomings, but actively works to provide efficient solutions. \u00a0During school board forums she has addressed that the mission of the district is to educate its students and that the \"quality of the teachers preempts everything.\" A pragmatic decision maker, Caswell advocates for an improved system of mental health services while acknowledging<\/span>\u00a0the district\u2019s limitations.\r\n\r\nIncumbents, including Caswell, have been criticized for their lack of transparency and mismanagement in regards to finances and dealing with the Office of Civil Rights over the past few years. However, Caswell has remained consistent\u00a0in her stances and takes the time to deliberate before outlining her position. Although she voiced her <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/26\/board-approves-raise-for-teachers\/\">support for the teacher pay raise<\/a>, Caswell is in favor of aggressive measures to reduce the deficit.\r\n\r\n<b>Jennifer DiBrienza: The Needed Educator<\/b>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_122799\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"263\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6351-1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-122799\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6351-1.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Dibrienza relied on her experiences as a Educational Consultant to provide explanations for her various stances.

Hopefully, she will help the board as a whole to recognize how each decision truly impacts the experience of a student.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Acknowledging the Competition<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabrera and Emberling have put up valiant efforts and their desire to aid the district\u2019s students should be recognized. Cabrera offers the grass-roots perspective and should be applauded for his campaign based entirely upon small donations. He offers bold ideas that would add value to innovations within any district. Similarly, Emberling\u2019s efforts over the past years have not been forgotten. Her emphasis on the best practices for each individual school is\u00a0worth noting.<\/span>\r\n\r\nCabrera, despite his ingenuity, has drawbacks; he has focused his efforts on emphasizing respectable beliefs against the current system of politics reliant upon money. He\u00a0strays away from providing adequate solutions to the specific problems faced by our community.\r\n\r\nEmberling, despite her time on the board, does not have a consistent\u00a0stance on issues that we feel are pertinent. She has contributed to the ambiguous statements that prevent the current board from efficiently making decisions.\r\n\r\nWhile many of us as minors cannot express our support via an actual vote, our hope is to garner support for those who we believe will serve our best interests as students and community members. Their actions and decisions will outlive our legacies as Palo Alto High School students, but the election of Collins, Caswell and DiBrienza will ensure the best experience for future PAUSD students.","excerpt":"After much deliberation as a staff, The Paly Voice has decided to endorse Todd Collins, incumbent Melissa Baten Caswell and Jennifer DiBrienza.

Paly would go on to lose to Los Gatos High School, 35-6 on Friday night at home. Photo: Jackson Doerr.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School Vikings football team (3-5, 2-2) is fighting for a spot in the De Anza league playoffs after losing its homecoming game against the Los Gatos Wildcats (4-3, 3-0), 35-6, last night on the Paly football field.\r\n\r\nThe game was an ordeal for the Vikings, who struggled to put\u00a0the Wildcats' strong offense on hold, throughout the entirety of the game.\r\n\r\nJust five minutes into the game, the Wildcats broke\u00a0through the Paly defense to score the first touchdown of the game.\u00a0The rest of the first quarter was a scoreless standoff, and the ball did not leave Paly's half.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter, Los Gatos gained 96 yards in ten plays over the course of two minutes and 12\u00a0seconds, and added another Wildcat touchdown to the scoreboard.\r\n\r\nOn the very next play, a player from each team was ejected for personal fouls, including Paly junior offensive lineman Bryant Jefferson.\r\n\r\nViking head coach Danny Sullivan\u00a0said he disagrees with\u00a0the call and he believes that the skirmish was not grounds for ejection of either player.\r\n\r\n\"It was just an overreaction to the play,\" Sullivan said. \"I was looking at it the whole time and I don't think anybody should have gotten ejected, including their kid.\"\r\n\r\nLos Gatos would go on to score twice in the 3rd and once in the 4th, bringing the score to 35-0. But with three minutes left in the game, Paly was able to get a touchdown, preventing the Wildcats from securing a shutout win.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sullivan, Paly struggled with performing smaller plays.\r\n\r\n\"We started moving the ball but we hit a wall,\" Sullivan said. \"Simple execution on little things is the difference between the two scores so we've got to get better at doing that.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Sullivan, the Vikings will continue to focus on working the kinks out of their play.\r\n\r\n\"It's just doing the fine tuning that we really have to focus on,\" Sullivan said. \"We've gotten so much better over the course of the season and we're only going to keep getting better.\"\r\n\r\nSullivan said the season is far from over, and the Vikings are in competition for a spot in the playoffs.\r\n\r\n\"We're playing for a playoff spot in these next two weeks,\"\u00a0Sullivan said. \"Next week is a bye week. We need to get a couple things neatened up and then it's off to Mountain View.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Sullivan, the Week Nine bye is a blessing in disguise.\r\n\r\n\"We were\u00a0looking at it and Week Nine looks like the worst time for a bye,\" Sullivan said. \"[However,] It comes at a perfect time because we need to jump back on the horse.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will fight for a spot in the playoffs against the Mountain View High School Spartans (6-3, 3-2) at 7:00pm on Nov. 4 at Mountain View.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Vikings football team (3-5, 2-2) are fighting for a spot in the De Anza league playoffs after losing their homecoming game against the Los Gatos Wildcats (4-3, 3-0) 35-6 last night on the Paly football field.","date":"2016-10-22 16:56:02","author":"William Sallomi","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/los-altos-v-pa.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports"],"tags":["danny sullivan","football","paul jackson iii","sports"]},{"id":124911,"title":"Video: Spirit Week Day 5 ends with dazzling performances","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/22\/video-spirit-week-day-5-ends-with-dazzling-performances\/","content":"The Paly Voice documented the fifth and final day of Palo Alto High School's Spirit Week. \"Paly Spirit Day\" featured the exciting \"Hula Hoop\" race at the lunch rally, as well as the unveiling of class floats and class dance performances after school\r\n\r\nFinal scores for Spirit Week will be released today during the Homecoming dance at Gunn High School.
