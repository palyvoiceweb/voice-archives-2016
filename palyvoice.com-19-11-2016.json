According to Anderson and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ehpcares.org\/about-us.html\">Ecumenical Hunger Program website<\/a>, the money and cans raised by the Turkey Trot are donated to the EHP in East Palo Alto, a non-profit organization who's mission is \"to sustain our neighbors through immediate crises and to help them regain stability and independence\".\r\n\r\nAccording to Paly parent and event organizer Melissa Anderson, this year's Turkey Trot will offered more options for students with dietary restrictions. The feast will provided options for vegetarians and gluten-free students, such as baked potatoes and vegetarian stuffing, along with gluten free pies, stuffing and gravy.\r\n\r\nAnderson, who has been organizing the Turkey Trot for seven years, finds the event to be her favorite Paly tradition.\r\n\r\n\"I love seeing all the kids come out,\" Anderson said. \"They all come out in mass. If you pick your head up at about noon, it's like 'Oh my goodness! I hope we have enough food', and then there's always seconds, everyone gets fed.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the end of this, we give five big barrels of canned goods to [The] Ecumenical Hunger [Program],\" Anderson said. \"I come over with anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000, and that helps their food and gift drive for their clients. We're a really major part of their offerings for their families.\"\r\n\r\nBelow is the breakdown of this years Turkey Trot feast statistics.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"overflow-y: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/magic.piktochart.com\/embed\/18235253-new-piktochart\" width=\"800\" height=\"1547\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"Student are returning to home with full bellies today after Palo Alto High School's 12th annual Turkey Trot, a feast in honor of Thanksgiving, took place at lunch on the Quad.

Photo from Imdb.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the production of its most recent film, \"Dr. Strange,\" Marvel brings a new side of superheroes to life, one that goes beyond the classic confines of conventional superpowers to introduce themes of mysticism and the occult. In the tradition of superhero movies, \"Dr. Strange\" is action packed, fast paced and pushes the envelope of visual effects to make a fantastical and unreal world come to life.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While all Marvel movies may emphasize mesmerizing imagery and exciting battle choreography, to the point of cookie-cutting plots and sacrificing dialogue, \"Dr. Strange\" doesn\u2019t quite fit the mold as closely as some of the previous installments. Superhero movies may be as Hollywood as it gets, but the film, along with Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as the titular character are distinguished with wittier lines, clever plot tricks and an eclectic musical score that give the audience more food for thought as it takes a surreal detour from Marvel's usual path.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe concept of an astral body, different dimensions and the ability for the mind to heal the body are explored with \"Dr. Strange,\" replacing the conventional superpowers in previous installments. The movie\u2019s depiction of these spiritual ideas is unfortunately shallow, as the thin layer of eastern-inspired practices covers up a lot of mystical mumbo-jumbo. That being said, the theme of humility and respect to a universal power is a repeating theme in the movie where egotistical Dr. Strange is humbled by its might, in a way that may allude back to eastern religious themes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie starts by introducing Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), \u00a0a brilliant and dexterous neurosurgeon from New York who's as arrogant as he is meticulous. The doctor\u2019s life is suddenly met with tragedy when he is victim to a car accident that leaves him severely damaged in both his hands. With his surgical career hanging on the line, Strange desperately seeks a cure, eventually traveling to Kathmandu, Nepal, after hearing of a miraculous case where a man overcame paralysis in the mysterious, secret compound of Kamar-Taj. What he finds there he cannot fully accept.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When the mysterious overseer of the compound, the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), introduces Kamar-Taj as a magic academy, both audiences and Dr. Strange are skeptical of what to expect, only to be literally blown away by her demonstration of mystical ability. The producer\u2019s decision to embrace the original story\u2019s eastern notion of sorcery created the opportunity to depict vivid Kaleidoscopic scenes of morphing buildings and psychedelically changing landscapes, breathtakingly bewitching when watched on an 80-foot screen. In the compound, Dr. Strange is taught how to manipulate and distort reality, the power of teleportation and altering time, in scenes that are reminiscent of classic sci-fis like \"<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Matrix\"<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and \"<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inception.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind the whimsy and excitement of the wondrous powers, an evil is emerging that threatens Kamar-Taj and the whole world. Dr. Strange and the compound\u2019s guardians, Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Wong (Benedict Wong) must defend\u00a0humanity from the evil ex-student, Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), who seeks revenge on the Ancient One by opening a gate to the \u201cDark Dimension\u201d.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Strange\u2019s own past unfolds as his journey returns him to his home city of New York and the very hospital he used to perform in. He rekindles things with his former romantic partner, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) who desperately tries keeping him alive as Strange\u2019s ghostly, astral body does dimensional battle with a dark sorcerer. The relationship between Strange and Christine develops throughout the course of the movie, as dynamically as the warping environments so expertly created through special effects.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important criteria for a good superhero flick is the wow factor of the battle scenes. The fighting sequences are less destructive than the usual arena-like melee duels of previous superhero movies, and more focused on disorienting and out-maneuvering the enemy. Dr. Strange may fight in or out of his body while the battlefield may jump from different corners of the Earth to different dimensions. Viewing the characters contest the streets of New York\u00a0and Hong Kong to other dimensions was especially spellbinding up-close in theaters with an intense original soundtrack adding to our immersion.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is certainly one movie worth seeing on a big-screen in theaters. The storyline was fast paced and engaging while the action was dazzling. Watching formulaic brawl scenes where opponents always use brawn can become very repetitive and tiresome, but \"Dr. Strange\" was a refreshing new breathe from Marvel\u2019s predictable past.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nRunning Time: 115 minutes\r\n\r\nDirector: Scott Derrickson\r\n\r\nCast: Benedict Cumberbatch-Stephen Strange &amp; Dormammu\r\n\r\nRachel McAdams-Christine Palmer\r\n\r\nTilda Swinton-The Ancient One\r\n\r\nMads Mikkelsen-Kaecilius\r\n\r\nChiwetel Ejiofor-Karl Mordo\r\n\r\nBenedict Wong-Wong\r\n\r\nMusic Composer: Michael Giacchino\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"In the production of its most recent film, &#8220;Dr. Strange,&#8221; Marvel brings a new side of superheroes to life, one that goes beyond the classic <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/17\/dr-strange-is-a-strangely-enticing-supernatural-adventure\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2016-11-17 18:22:51","author":"Donnesh Farmanfarmaian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/doctor-strange-cumberbatch-magic-powers.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Spotlight"],"tags":["Dr. Strange","film","marvel","movie review"]},{"id":126248,"title":"Verbatim: Vikings share motivations for attending peace march","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/17\/verbatim-vikings-share-motivations-for-attending-peace-march\/","content":"Palo Alto High School students joined others from around the Bay Area in a peaceful demonstration Tuesday afternoon at downtown Palo Alto.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration was intended to spread messages of love and acceptance, and was inspired by the unrest that many students felt because of derogatory comments made during the 2016 presidential election.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice asked students why they decided to attend the march.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.thinglink.com\/card\/855323001644646402\" width=\"700\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School students joined others from around the bay area in a peaceful demonstration Tuesday afternoon at downtown Palo Alto.

Photo: Katie Cox[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Palo Alto High School theater department delivered laughter to the new Performing Arts Center with\u00a0the play, \u201cThe Importance of Being Earnest.\u201d The performers entertained the audience earlier this month with clever\u00a0acting and realistic Victorian English accents. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Importance of Being Earnest\u201d centers on\u00a0two young men, Moncrieff and Worthing. Hoping to woo their love interests, Cecily and Gwendolyn, they both adopt the name Earnest. However, when they end up in the country together, their true identities are discovered. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The talented cast delivered the lines with the perfect amount of wit and charm to win the audience over. Both Jackson Kienitz (Moncrieff) and Jason Pollak (Worthing) portrayed their characters in a charming light to show the friendship between the two men perfectly. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audience was still able to relate and laugh as the characters desperately try to impress their love interests. Nadia Leinhos, alternating with Claire Eberhart, as Lady Bracknell was extraordinary as Moncrieff's aunt; her character brought laughter to the audience with her exaggerated snobbery and patronizing attitude. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mia Trubelja (Gwendolyn) was nothing short of hilarious acting as a girl who had high expectations and didn\u2019t seem to want to accept any man except for one with the name of Earnest. This humor created a light atmosphere and made the performance enjoyable. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only did the brilliant cast help entertain the audience, but the cultured and sophisticated British accents the actors adopted helped transport the viewers to a different place and era. After multiple lessons on these accents, the cast should be proud of the final outcome as every single one of them sounded authentic\u00a0and believable.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The costumes, makeup and set were extremely well-done, but not over the top. \u00a0The set itself was also beautiful and classy. It was very intricately designed and it set the tone for the rest of the play. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The performance was fairly long, with three different acts and only two 10 minute breaks. However, the viewers were always engaged and laughing. The play had a bit of a slow start as it took some time for new characters to enter, but once they did, the play was quickly brought to life and entertaining. In addition to the play itself, as people took their seats and the lights dimmed, five talented musicians took to the stage and sang, danced and played the piano to set the mood before the actors revealed themselves. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Importance of Being Earnest\u201d was the perfect comedy to commence the theater department's year. \u00a0The stellar acting and realistic set and costumes made the play both enjoyable and relatable to viewers. This wonderful production augurs well for future PAC performances.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School theater department delivered laughter to the new Performing Arts Center with\u00a0the play, \u201cThe Importance of Being Earnest.\u201d The performers entertained <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/17\/review-the-importance-of-being-earnest-brings-victorian-era-to-life\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2016-11-17 08:52:36","author":"Katie Cox","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/importanceofbeingearnest.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Reviews"],"tags":["fall play","pac","theatre department"]},{"id":126263,"title":"Thanksgiving Break will be from Nov. 23 to Nov. 25","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/17\/thanksgiving-break-will-be-from-nov-23-to-nov-25\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-11-17 08:45:32","author":"Chirag Akella","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":124363,"title":"Paly then and now","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/17\/paly-then-and-now\/","content":"Since its opening in 1898, Palo Alto High School's campus has undergone multiple transformations and seen the addition of several construction projects.

Photo: William Sallomi[\/caption]\r\n\r\nCalifornia's public schools will provide diverse options for elementary level students seeking proficiency in the English language after a proposition removing the mandate of exclusively English education\u00a0was passed on the state\u00a0ballot last week.\r\n\r\nProp. 58 is a legal measure that gives\u00a0elementary level students who are learning English as a second language the choice of either beginning with \u00a0bilingual education, or being\u00a0immediately\u00a0integrated into English immersion classes. While students do have more educational options, the proposition -now law-\u00a0still requires that all students become proficient in English.\r\n\r\nProp. 58\u00a0passed with a \u00a0remarkable approval rating of\u00a0approximately 73 percent.\r\n\r\nAccording to Spanish teacher and former instructional supervisor of the Palo Alto High School World\u00a0Languages department Kevin Duffy, English-only programs are detrimental to a young student's native language.\r\n\r\n\"According to many studies,\u00a0a single language program will cause students to ignore their native language,\" Duffy said.\u00a0\u00a0\"This is because your goal is just to learn English, and not to maintain your proficiency in your native language.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Duffy, the proposition's emphasis on preserving students' bilingual status is important for America.\r\n\r\n\"The goal [for the students] should be that upon graduating from high school, they should be a strong group of bilingual students,\" Duffy said.\u00a0\"In America, we need people who speak more than one language, so why not use the native abilities of immigrant students?\"\r\n\r\nDuffy said that although the proposition has its benefits, for some communities who have diverse\u00a0immigrant populations, it may be impractical.\r\n\r\n\"Here in California we have a diverse group of students who speak a wide\u00a0variety of languages, so it wouldn't be very practical to have a program for each native language,\" Duffy said. \"It's unfair to say that we can help students who speak one language over those who speak another, which can make the process\u00a0difficult.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Paly Spanish teacher Pilar Alonso, who taught English to young Latino\u00a0children, a bilingual program is important for helping students learn English while still maintaining their cultural roots.\r\n\r\n\"The bilingual program [at which Alonso\u00a0worked] was initially started because there was no system to help kindergarten students with no English speaking experience become integrated\u00a0into a fully English school system,\" Alonso said.\u00a0\"The goal was that the students would learn English over the course of four\u00a0years, and during that time they also learned to read in their own language,\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Alonso, each year the classes gradually transitioned from Spanish to English until the students were able to make the leap into standard English classes.\r\n\r\n\"Kindergarten classes were carried out 90 percent in Spanish, and 10 percent in English,\" Alonso said.\u00a0\"By the time they were in third grade, the students would be enrolled in the fully English courses.\"\r\n\r\nAlonso said that the bilingual education was crucial in preparing the students for success, while helping them draw connections between two languages and cultures.\r\n\r\n\"The program worked phenomenally because the kids left completely prepared, and transitioned what they learned about their own languages to English,\" Alonso said.\u00a0\"Bilingual students\u00a0need this kind of support in school.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the passing of the proposition, the state will now be tasked with implementing these bilingual programs into public schools.","excerpt":"California's public schools will provide diverse options for elementary level students seeking proficiency in the English language after a proposition removing the mandate of exclusively English education was passed on the state ballot last week.","date":"2016-11-16 18:40:53","author":"William Sallomi","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Alonso.jpg","categories":["Global Outlook","News","Uncategorized"],"tags":["education","election","Jose Ezcurra","Kevin Duffy","language","Pilar Alonso","Prop 58"]}]
