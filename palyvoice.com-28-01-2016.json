However, Baten-Caswell says that based on enrollment data, she is not convinced that a new school is needed to fix overcrowding issues.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf we don't need a new school, do we want a new school?\u201d Baten-Caswell said. \u201cI think that's really the question we need to ask at this point is do we want a new school, not whether we need it.

Photo by Chirag Akella.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School robotics team is starting to prepare for its upcoming season after learning of this year's challenge.\r\n\r\nThe team started the season off by focusing on strategic planning, according to team captain Claire Kokontis.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re working on this year is focusing on strategy first instead of robot design,\u201d Kokontis said. \u201cLast year we got wrapped into a robot design without thinking what we wanted our robot to do. After you get into one design, you\u2019re stuck with what your robot can do with that design, so by thinking about strategy first, we want to open ourselves up and be creative.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Build Captain Kenneth Cheung, this year's challenge has a medieval theme where the robot has to fire dodgeballs into towers. The robot also has to be able to navigate through several obstacles in order to reach said towers.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cheung, the strategy talk involved a myriad of topics that the team has to address.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe just watched the video this morning and focused on strategy,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cWe split up into three groups and went into these individual classrooms and wrote down on a whiteboard all the reasons we could score, all the reasons we could defend and all the restrictions we might have. After that we brainstormed game strategy--do we want to focus on weaker defenses, or do we want to focus on rough terrain, or do we want to focus on shooting balls?\"\r\n\r\nKokontis says she hopes the increased emphasis on strategy can help the team improve on last year\u2019s performance, where they placed 38th place out of 49 and 53rd place out of 57 at the Central Valley and Silicon Valley tournaments respectively.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast year we didn\u2019t do super great,\u201d Kokontis said. \u201cBut this year we know how to do a lot more than we did last year. I am hoping to get in the top 15 [in the First Stronghold tournament] somewhere or go to the elimination rounds.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe season officially kicks off with the Central Valley Regional tournament on March 10.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School robotics team has started its preparations for its upcoming season after learning of this year's challenge.","date":"2016-01-26 11:34:38","author":"Chirag Akella","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/12544195_197840773898480_611464048_o.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["cheung","FirstStronghold","kokontis","paly","robotics"]},{"id":114927,"title":"International lunch is on Thursday, Feb. 4","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/26\/international-lunch-is-on-thursday-feb-4\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-26 10:43:13","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":114925,"title":"AMC testing is on Tuesday, Feb. 2","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/26\/amc-testing-is-on-tuesday-feb-2\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-26 10:41:25","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":114923,"title":"National counseling week is from Monday, Feb. 1 through Friday, Feb. 5","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/26\/national-counseling-week-is-from-monday-feb-1-through-friday-feb-5\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-26 10:40:31","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":114730,"title":"Editorial: Explore other avenues to counter overcrowding","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/25\/editorial-explore-other-avenues-to-counter-overcrowding\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_114838\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/unnamed1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-114838\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/unnamed1.jpg\" alt=\"Sophomores Sam Guernsey, and Michaela Fogarty work on a project in Social Justice Pathway.

According to the Palo Alto High School course catalog, \"The Social Justice Pathway is a three-year program featuring self-direction and project-based learning in an interdisciplinary\u00a0model rooted in community action and collaboration.\" Photo by Cooper Lou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnticipating an influx in the number of students enrolled in the district, the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education has been contemplating a series of proposals to build new schools to accommodate a larger student population. At the school board meeting on Jan. 6, the Enrollment and Management Advisory Committee, created to conduct research on school sizes and overcrowding, recommended further exploration of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pausd.org\/sites\/default\/files\/pdf-faqs\/attachments\/EMACSecondarySubcommitteeFinalReport.pdf\">five different proposals<\/a>, one of which calls for building a new high school that emphasizes project-based learning at the Cubberley Community Center. While we appreciate the effort that has gone into researching solutions to the problem, we believe that the district should not adopt the plan to transform Cubberley into an \u201cinnovative school\u201d that will benefit only a relative few. Instead, it ought to focus its attention on expanding project-based learning opportunities at existing high schools.\r\n\r\nProject-based learning is a hands-on classroom approach in which students actively explore real-world problems in the form of research, projects and presentations.\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Increased access to project-based learning\u00a0would be a welcome addition to Palo Alto schools, but the more pressing issue is overcrowding, and the board should be directing its time and resources accordingly. All of the five EMAC recommendations included a provision to build another school, but not one suggested focusing on expanding the physical capacity of Gunn and Palo Alto High School or hiring more instructors. The reality is that district funding is finite, and the millions of dollars\u00a0of\u00a0annual operational costs for the\u00a0proposed high school would best be spent improving the current high schools. In fact, the city has already taken steps to increase\u00a0funds for existing schools \u2014 last year, Palo Alto passed <\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http:\/\/pausd-web.pausd.org\/community\/2015MeasureA\/index.shtml\">Measure A<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">, which established a parcel tax. The revenue will be used to hire more teachers and keep class sizes small, which is a path we should continue to take.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, several problems will arise if Cubberley is to be a transformed into an innovative school \u2014 first and foremost is the issue of funding. Providing students at the new school with the smaller class sizes and breadth of course offerings recommended by the EMAC will require spending more dollars per student, which is in direct conflict with <a href=\"http:\/\/pausd-web.pausd.org\/community\/board\/Policies\/downloads\/BP6171_TitleI.pdf\">Board Policy 6171<\/a>. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have a commitment in the school board for equal funding for students across each of our schools,\u201d said board member Ken Dauber, who agrees that the district should focus on improving the current schools, rather than building another one, in an interview with The Paly Voice. \u201cSo it\u2019s not possible for us to spend more money per student. The alternative that I have heard is using private funding to make up the difference and supplement the spending so that we\u2019re not spending more public dollars per student. This is also not possible under our current policies, because we don\u2019t want to create a fundraising arms race between schools where they raise money for their own students, more so than other schools, creating inequity.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the proposal could be modified so that the costs of the new school are in accordance with Board Policy 6171, which is improbable, money and time would still be better directed toward solving the numerous other pressing problems in the district, like Gunn's\u00a0ineffective advisory system, oversized\u00a0classes, limited access\u00a0to project-based learning and the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/29\/school-board-discusses-achievement-gap-solutions\/\">achievement gap<\/a>\u00a0\u2014 the discrepancy in\u00a0academic performance between socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged students. Overcrowding is certainly an issue, but it is not the only one. The district needs to prioritize.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not seem so, the opening of a new high school with the lottery system could\u00a0create a socio-economic inequality that we see in the district's other lottery schools, Ohlone Elementary and Hoover Elementary Schools. On average,\u00a08.95% of students in the district's elementary schools\u00a0are socio-economically disadvantaged, according to\u00a0the most <a href=\"http:\/\/pausd-web.pausd.org\/community\/about\/sar.shtml\">recent School Accountability Report Cards<\/a>, compared to the significantly lower 3.5% at Ohlone, and 5.1% at Hoover. A\u00a0lottery system theoretically\u00a0ensures equal opportunity for all students, but realistically speaking, current and past trends show that less\u00a0socio-economically disadvantaged\u00a0students will apply than\u00a0what should be\u00a0considered equal. The district should avoid pursuing\u00a0a\u00a0project that could potentially\u00a0exacerbate the achievement gap.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the proposed high school would be able to hold about 400-600 students, which, considering the amount of money that would have to be spent, is a negligible dent in the projected maximum of 4100 high school students districtwide. Since the school would be so much smaller than both Paly and Gunn, enrollment would likely have to be determined through a lottery system. It seems contrary to the goals of the district to spend disproportionate amounts of money on a venture that only stands to benefit a select few. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a new high school entirely is impractical at this point in time, but it is possible that in the next several years, the increase in student population necessitates opening another campus. If the district goes down this path, the new school should be similar to Paly and Gunn in regards to its structure and course offerings, rather than an exclusively project-based learning school.<\/span>\r\n\r\nProponents for the new school argue that many students feel disconnected from their learning, and are looking for a more personal education experience which can be provided at\u00a0a new school. Although it is true that 5%\u00a0of students at <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B0Te89oAASzOTU9wZjdrTkJ3X0U\/view\">Paly <\/a>and 9% of students at <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B0Te89oAASzOZHQtbFBGZ05vSXc\/view\">Gunn <\/a>have little to no engagement in\u00a0learning according to a survey by the school board in cooperation with Stanford, it would be significantly\u00a0more cost efficient to create more non-traditional, project-based learning opportunities at the current schools. The district can explore creating additional programs similar to the Social Justice Pathway or the Sports Career Pathway that provide students with a more personalized learning experience, while\u00a0increasing innovative educational opportunities for all students. At the same time, creating more of such pathways would draw students out of traditional classes, and effectively lessen class sizes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We should be directing our time and energy toward enhancing the learning experience for the entire student body, rather than getting swept up in the novelty of a specialty school that will serve only a small sector of the population.<\/span>","excerpt":"We believe that the district should focus its attention on expanding project-based learning opportunities at existing high schools, rather than adopting the plan to transform Cubberley into an \u201cinnovative school\u201d that will benefit only a relative few.","date":"2016-01-25 19:11:00","author":"The Paly Voice","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/unnamed1.jpg\nmodel rooted in community action and collaboration.&quot; Photo by Cooper Lou.\" \/>","categories":["Editorial","Opinion","Opinion Editor's Pick","Spotlight"],"tags":[]},{"id":114855,"title":"Recap: Boys&#8217; soccer defeats Santa Clara 2-0 and continues streak","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/25\/recap-boys-soccer-defeats-santa-clara-2-0-and-continues-streak\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_114916\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"273\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-25-at-11.22.45-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-114916 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-25-at-11.22.45-PM.png\" alt=\"The Vikings went on to win 2-0, maintaining an undefeated league record today after school at Palo Alto High School in a game against Santa Clara High School.
