A lot of that was being too nervous or us putting too much pressure on ourselves. We just have to relax.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe momentum shifted in the second quarter when junior forward Julie Chandler dished assists to sophomore forward Sophie Frick on backdoor cuts on two consecutive possessions. Frick\u2019s layups helped the Vikings take the lead, 22-19.\r\n\r\nSenior center Courtney Lovely was the leading scorer for the team with 13 points, though the Vikings struggled with shooting overall, according to senior guard Maddy Atwater.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe rush our shots sometimes and we don\u2019t need to,\u201d Atwater said. \u201cWe just have to relax and take our shots.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe amount of energy from the team, amplified by the crowd, helped Paly to come back from their first quarter performance, according to Peters.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey scored 19 points and we didn\u2019t get down,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIn the first quarter, we just kept at it with that same energy, and that paid off.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior guard Lauren Koyama also emphasized the significance of the team\u2019s energy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were very amped up,\u201d Koyama said. \u201cThe crowd brought energy that kind of made us overwhelmed, but we played well and we did what we wanted to do \u2026 we really got after it and we had a ton of energy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will face off against the Saratoga Falcons (10-4, 1-1) at 7 p.m. on Tuesday at Gunn, Paly\u2019s home gym for the season.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' basketball team (8-4, 1-1) routed cross-town rival Gunn High School (8-4, 0-2) with a 49-34 Quad Night win last Friday at Gunn.","date":"2016-01-12 22:29:32","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_7851.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap"],"tags":["ball is life","basketball","coco lovely","girls basketball","gunn","julie chandler","lauren koyama","maddy atwater","palo alto","palo alto high school","paly","Quad Night","scott peters","sophie frick","titans","vikings"]},{"id":114161,"title":"Football head coach resigns","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/12\/football-head-coach-resigns\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School football team is preparing to adapt to a new coaching situation, as its head coach's resignation from his position was confirmed on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nHead coach Jake Halas confirmed his resignation after two years in that position after taking over for long-time head coach Earl Hansen, largely because he wants to spend more time with his family.\r\n\r\n\u201cI did step down,\u201d Halas said. \u201cA variety of factors contributed to this, but the overriding factor was basically family. Just the chance to see the kids at home. I have three kids under six years old and that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to put my focus right now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Halas, the head coach position is open to anyone, and a committee to search for a new head coach is already on the hunt to fill his\u00a0spot.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s open to whoever [within qualification],\u201d Halas said. \u201cThey [committee members] are actively searching. I\u2019d be shocked if they don\u2019t have a person in place by February. They have to get a head football coach sooner rather than later just because there\u2019s so much stuff to do.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite stepping down from coaching the football team, Halas will stay at Paly as a physical education teacher and a football supporter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to support in any way I can,\u201d Halas said. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue teaching in the spot I\u2019m in, but I\u2019m not going to coach football or any other sport for the next couple of years. I\u2019m going to coach my kids' teams, as a matter of fact.\u201d\r\n\r\nHalas is still thinking about coaching in the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to reset,\u201d Halas said. \u201cI\u2019m not done coaching, I have a lot of coaching left in me, but I have to back away for a while and reset.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the fall, the Vikings (5-7, 3-3) competed in the Central Coast Section playoffs through the semifinal round. Sophomore kicker Max Dorward was shocked by Halas\u2019 resignation and recognizes the challenges this may pose for future seasons.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was pretty surprised he decided to resign because he did a great job with us this past season,\u201d Dorward said. \u201cIt will be challenging for next season because we have to adapt to a new head coach. Whenever there\u2019s a coaching change in sports, there are always changes [to the team] and that can be difficult for returning players.\u201d","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School football team is preparing to adapt to a new coaching situation, as its head coach has officially resigned from his position.","date":"2016-01-12 20:01:28","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/rsz_img_1343.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["football","halas","max dorward","palo alto high school","paly","Paly football"]},{"id":114184,"title":"Kenyon Scott&#8217;s memorial will be at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 23 on the Paly Quad","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/12\/kenyon-scotts-memorial-will-be-at-2-p-m-on-saturday-jan-23-on-the-paly-quad\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-12 18:14:39","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":113098,"title":"Blogger without borders: Refugee stories, Part 3","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/12\/blogger-without-borders-refugee-stories-part-3\/","content":"<em>The third and final installment of \"Blogger without borders: Refugee stories,\" where\u00a0<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">junior Bianca Al-Shamari\u00a0shares refugees' stories that are translated from\u00a0Farsi, Russian and Mongolian.<\/span><\/em>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_114149\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"627\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/12399082_1680231118856874_1609822708_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-114149\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/12399082_1680231118856874_1609822708_n.jpg\" alt=\"12399082_1680231118856874_1609822708_n\" width=\"627\" height=\"470\" \/><\/a> A section of an Austrian refugee camp in Schwechat houses men, women and children in make-shift bedding.

The next day we got on board a boat in dangerous conditions, with cross winds and with approximately 53 people. We arrived to the island of 'Mesrini,' then, after being near Klini, arrived in Greece.

Stoksik accredited much of the team\u2019s success to its defensive play.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoach told us to pick it up at halftime, and we did that,\u201d Stoksik said. \u201cI thought that we were really solid defensively and kept it tight.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly was able to secure the win through the effort of all of its players and their ability to work together, according to senior goalkeeper Eli Friedlander.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe stayed organized in the back, and they didn\u2019t get any clear cut chances,\u201d Friedlander said. \u201cEveryone came out here and played really hard. When we play as hard as we did today, we\u2019re going to win a lot of the 50-50 balls and that\u2019s going to put us in a good position to win a game.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to senior center defender Reuben Kramer, the Vikings struggled with staying focused and composed, as play was fast-paced throughout the match.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe struggled the most in keeping our composure,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThere were a couple of moments when we got excited when they had the ball and we started not thinking rationally. It was just us getting outside of our heads.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Mustangs were the biggest defensive challenge for Paly so far this season, according to Briggs.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were pushing us,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest that our defense has been pushed this year.\u201d\r\n\r\nBriggs intends to address the team\u2019s issue of staying in position and adjusting appropriately.\r\n\r\n\u201cRight now, we need to work on keeping our shape,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cWe have guys flying out to try to defend or get a ball and they leave a hole behind them and then they [other team] start play-making us.\u201d\r\n\r\nHomestead head coach Luis Comesana recognized his own team\u2019s struggle to possess and stay composed under high pressure.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe needed to possess the ball a little bit more,\u201d Comesana said. \u201cWe were rushed. We were put under pressure. I think that today, the better team won.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the score, Comesana remained proud of his players' resilience.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe fought back,\u201d Comesana said. \u201cAs a coach, you always want your players to give their best all the way to the end, no matter what the score is.\u201d\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, the Vikings hope to live up to <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/01\/22\/liveblog-boys-soccer-fights-for-first-in-league-against-homestead\/\">last year\u2019s record<\/a> with a De Anza League title, according to Stoksik.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we continue in this form, I think we definitely have a shot at winning league,\u201d Stoksik said.\r\n\r\nPaly will play its cross-town rivals, the Gunn Titans, at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday at Gunn High School.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 soccer team (2-0, 6-1) shut out the Homestead Mustangs (1-1, 7-2-2) 2-0 on Friday in its second De Anza League game of the season.\r\n","date":"2016-01-11 11:16:25","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_78001.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["boys soccer","briggs","comesana","de anza","friedlander","homestead","kramer","mustangs","palo alto high school","paly","Soccer","sports","stoksik","vikings"]},{"id":114040,"title":"Advisory this week on Tuesday for freshmen and juniors","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/10\/no-advisory-this-week\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-10 12:04:33","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":114038,"title":"Winter Rally is this Thursday, Jan. 14 on the Lacrosse Field","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/10\/winter-rally-is-this-thursday-jan-14-on-the-lacrosse-field\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-10 12:03:30","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":113812,"title":"Recap: Girls&#8217; soccer dominates Los Gatos","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/09\/recap-girls-soccer-dominates-los-gatos\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_114024\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"499\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-09-at-8.58.40-PM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-114024\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-09-at-8.58.40-PM.png\" alt=\"Sophomore Emily Tomz dribbles towards a Los Gatos defender as Paly takes an early 1-0 lead.
