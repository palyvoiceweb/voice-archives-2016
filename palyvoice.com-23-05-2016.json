[{"id":119988,"title":"&#8220;The Jungle Book&#8221; reinvents an old story","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/22\/the-jungle-book-reinvents-an-old-story\/","content":"<hr \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the opening minutes of the film, a scene of a jungle filled with tangled vines and blooming flowers unfolds before our eyes. Then there\u2019s thudding footsteps, wolves and a boy in a red loincloth named Mowgli. Mowgli\u2019s entrance is fast-paced, with darting camera angles that track his running through beautifully animated trees. The action-based start sets up the tone of the movie and lets the audience know that this is much more than a children's movie.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"The Jungle Book,\" directed by Jon Favreau, follows closely to the original 1967 movie. The tale follows the young man-cub Mowgli who was raised in amidst wolves and swinging vines in the vast jungle. The adventure begins as Mowgli is forced from his home by the tiger Shere Khan and has to run away from the wolf clan that raised him. It's a story about friendship, about man's relationship to nature and most prominently the story of this young boy as he discovers his place in the world.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike the Disney\u2019s animated 1967 version of \"<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Jungle Book<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\" this version takes a decidedly large turn towards the darker and sinister side of this coming-of-age story. Social commentary is subtly weaved throughout Mowgli\u2019s adventure, as he not only faces the \"eat or be eaten\" policy of the jungle, but also how mankind is a threat to the environment with the invention of fire. This new movie is a beautiful CGI rendition of the original that is worth seeing. <\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_119991\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"308\"]<img class=\"wp-image-119991\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/junglebookcast2_zpsjjcigkuo.jpg\" alt=\"junglebookcast2_zpsjjcigkuo\" width=\"308\" height=\"219\" \/> Actor's Scarlet Johanson and Christopher Walken pose with their CGI charter counterparts in a promotional shoot for the \"The Jungle Book\" Movie.

The jungle is equal parts dangerous and beautiful and through enchanting CGI, Favreau is able to artfully maneuver us through its tangled vines, majestic beasts and dark corners. The iconic scene where Mowgli is trapped by the breathy, seductive voice of Kaa, the gigantic python voiced by Scarlett Johansson, perfectly encapsulates the ominous atmosphere of the movie. The choice to switch Kaa\u2019s voice to a woman really enhanced the spine-tingling atmosphere and hypnotic sequence. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sizes of the animals in the movie are blown out of proportion. Sometimes they were twice, three times or even ten times their actual size (we\u2019re looking at you King Louie \u2014 way to scare the kids). The size of the animals serve to encapsulate the \"child's view of the world\" which we see through Mowgli's eyes. Mowgli\u2019s view of the world warps our perception of reality. Although sometimes the enormous quality of some of the animals is enjoyable, King Louie\u2019s disgusting folds of skin are a bit excessive.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The live actor in the movie, is 12-year-old Neel Sethi who plays the character of Mowgli. For a child actor, Sethi does an excellent job of portraying the emotion of a scared but also fearless boy who lives in the jungle. From outrage to confusion his facial expressions are convincing, from outrage to confusion, and he manages to seem serious and childishly humorous at the same. His acting takes the point across; this is a boy that is loyal to his friends and family and will do anything he can to stay in the jungle. Of course, \u201canything\u201d always means more trouble.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_119989\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"221\"]<img class=\"wp-image-119989\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/The-Jungle-Book-Special-Shoot-BAGHEERA-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"The-Jungle-Book-Special-Shoot-BAGHEERA-683x1024\" width=\"221\" height=\"332\" \/> British film star Ben Kingsley sits next to the CGI panther Bagheera who he voices in the film. Photo courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Mischief comes in the form of a honey-seeking, carefree, grizzly bear by the name of Baloo. And who better to play the voice of Baloo than Bill Murray? The singing bear is\u00a0perfect comic relief for what could have otherwise been an overly dark movie. If a voice could ever be cantankerous, Murray is the one to pull it off. The song \u201cThe Bear Necessities\u201d makes an entrance, but in a\u00a0non-obtrusive way - just enough of a snippet to give a nod to the old song. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other song featured in the new movie is \u201cI Wanna Be Like You,\u201d sung by famous actor Christopher Walken as King Louie. Walken\u2019s raspy voice is perfect for the haunting\u00a0spin put on the classic song.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new film keeps the narrator of the story, the panther Bagheera, voiced by the smooth and polished voice of Ben Kingsley. A perfect posh voice for an uptight panther.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The Jungle Book\" movie presented the perfect blend of beautiful CGI and amazing voice work. The new movie masterfully renewed the original by adding a significantly dark sinister atmosphere. We recommend the movie to anyone wishing to rediscover this childhood classic, revisit classic songs and discover a sinister yet gorgeous CGI jungle.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"In the opening minutes of the film, a scene of a jungle filled with tangled vines and blooming flowers unfolds before our eyes.

The next day, the number in this class had dwindled to around seven students. Photo: Adrienne Kwok.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nApproximately 75 percent of Palo Alto High School juniors opted out of the Smarter Balanced test on Tuesday and Wednesday.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had roughly 25 percent of the students show up,\u201d Assistant Principal Adam Paulson said. \u201cIt seemed like it was a little bit less this year. \u2026 We\u2019ve done these [California Standardized] tests for many years, and we\u2019ve never got this non-turn out before. I guess we\u2019re [admin] trying to grapple with why people are opting out.\u201d\r\n\r\nCalifornia Education Code \u00a760615 permits students to opt out of California tests if their school receives a note of excuse from their parents. Last year about 50 percent of juniors <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/27\/where-is-everyone-students-opt-out-of-smarter-balanced-test\/\">opted out of the SBAC<\/a>.\r\n\r\nWith such a small number of student participants, the administration will not be able to receive an accurate score of how the student body is performing academically.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need a 95 percent threshold to get a score for the school to get accurate data, which obviously we didn\u2019t hit,\u201d Paulson said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Paulson, the administration can do little to ensure that students take the test.\r\n\r\n\u201cObviously we want more kids to participate, but a lot of it is out of our hands,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural thing. Students don\u2019t see the benefit in it [the SBAC].\u201d\r\n\r\nLast week, Principal Kim Diorio <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/16\/smarter-balance-testing-to-begin-tomorrow\/\">encouraged students<\/a> to take the test via a Schoology message.\r\n\r\n\"Smarter Balanced Testing is a low stakes assessment for students but a high-stakes test for our high school and it's state-wide and national rankings, as well as being the primary source for school-wide data to inform our WASC continuous improvement process,\" Diorio wrote.\r\n\r\nJunior Dani Macuil says she opted out of the test as it occurred shortly after Advanced Placement exams and a few weeks before final exams.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to Smarter Balance testing because I felt like it was unfair to ask students to do another week of testing on top of APs and getting ready for finals,\u201d Macuil said. \u201cI also knew that 95 percent of students wouldn\u2019t show up; therefore, it would be pointless to go anyways because it still wouldn\u2019t meet the requirements.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Lydia Miller, her class experienced\u00a0several technical issues on the first day of testing.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost of the computers didn\u2019t have it [the exam] on there,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe had to go from computer to computer to see which had the test on it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the test, classes partook in discussions about the parts of a coffee cup to help solve math equations about a cup. On the second day, English teachers conducted a discussion about the definition of poetry and prose before starting the exam. While some students found the introduction helpful, others including junior Isabella Bernard found the discussions unhelpful in solving the problems and said they only wasted time.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [the discussions] weren't\u00a0even relevant to the problems,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to know any of it to do the problems.\u201d","excerpt":"Approximately 75 percent of Palo Alto High School juniors opted out of the Smarter Balanced test on Tuesday and Wednesday.","date":"2016-05-19 22:29:35","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/13225152_1706672769592750_1831332758_o.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["balanced","exam","sbac","smarter","test"]},{"id":120344,"title":"City ordinance prohibits inflatables during Field Day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/19\/city-ordinance-prohibits-inflatables-during-field-day\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_72113\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"440\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo-3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72113\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo-3.jpg\" alt=\"Junior Meera Bhide exits a large, blow-up slide that is included at every field day.

What makes a release of emotions beautiful is when an artist is able to spin it into a more positive, hopeful message.\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s visual album \"Lemonade,\" released in late April, has a meaningful message that goes beyond the topic of her husband's infidelity. It is an empowering visual album that showcases the strength of women and African Americans.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Her hour-long music video incorporates all of the songs in the album with each song representing a different emotional stage. In between and throughout each song Beyonc\u00e9 provides moving narration that includes religious references, reflections on her life and historical events. Although sometimes it can be hard to understand the entire message, the variety of ways to analyze the composition makes \"Lemonade\"\u00a0a literature geek's dream.<\/p>\r\nThe stages of grief represented in the album include intuition, denial, anger, apathy, emptiness, accountability, reformation, forgiveness, resurrection, hope and redemption. Although all of these stages include a unique and powerful message, here are some of the most memorable components in Beyonc\u00e9's\u00a0visual album.\r\n\r\nAfter the first song \u201cPray You Catch Me,\u201d which is in the intuition stage and is the introduction to her visual album, Beyonc\u00e9 provides narration as she is captured swimming in an underwater bedroom. The tempo\u00a0is very slow, providing an eerie effect to the scene as Beyonc\u00e9 sings a variety of melodious harmonies. The lyrics add to the sinister tone with phrases like \"pray to catch you whispering.\"\r\n\r\nShe then\u00a0transitions into the next song \u2014 \u201cHold Up,\u201d the denial stage. \u201cHold Up\u201d begins with Beyonc\u00e9 wearing\u00a0a striking yellow dress as she opens the doors and water floods out from the bedroom. This is one of the most famous clips from her music video and she is seen smashing cars with a bat strutting down the street. \u201cHold Up\u201d provides a reggae vibe that is peaceful and soothing, which is a striking contrast to\u00a0her violent actions in the video when\u00a0she smashes cars while\u00a0swinging a bat. \u00a0The medium pace of the song is well thought out, making the scene just the right tempo instead of too rushed. Throughout the denial stage, Beyonc\u00e9 portrays herself as delighted as\u00a0she destroys\u00a0the cars and the streets. Towards the end of this scene, children and others gather behind Beyonc\u00e9 as they join her\u00a0in the streets. This portrayal\u00a0of solidarity showcases the surprising aspect of the scene: for a song about denial, the tune is almost happy and unnervingly relaxed.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_50211\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"488\"]<img class=\"wp-image-50211\" src=\"http:\/\/thevandallist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Watch-Beyonc%C3%A9%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9CLemonade%E2%80%9D-HBO-Album-Movie-the-vandallist-2.jpg\" alt=\"Watch Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d HBO Album Movie - the vandallist (2)\" width=\"488\" height=\"276\" \/> Beyonc\u00e9 struts down the streets wearing a yellow dress and destroying cars with a bat in the song \"Hold Up,\" the denial stage of grief. Photo from Beyonc\u00e9's visual album.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the anger stage with the song \"Don't Hurt Yourself (ft. Jack White)\" the visual album flashes the phrase, \u201cGod is God and I am not.\u201d It then leads into the next song \"Sorry,\" the apathy stage, featuring No. 1 ranked women\u2019s tennis player Serena Williams in the song. The faster beat and sassiness of\u00a0the song embodies more of the diva and \u201cqueen\u201d that Beyonc\u00e9 is known to be. Serena Williams and Beyonc\u00e9 dance around a room and a bus as they sing \u201cI ain\u2019t sorry\u201d repeatedly. This song is most popular for the lyrics, \u201cBecky with the good hair,\u201d which has sprung controversy as to who Becky is and if it has to do with Jay Z\u2019s cheating scandal.\r\n\r\n\u201cSandcastles\u201d is Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most vulnerable song as it is the forgiveness stage and features Jay-Z. She is pictured laying with a veil over her head standing in the ocean. The song itself is slowed down with the simplicity of the piano playing in the background. \"Sandcastles\" shows a softer side to Beyonc\u00e9 as her voice cracks, emphasizing raw emotion and her personal struggles. With Jay-Z featured in this stage, she shows vulnerability and allows the public to see a glimpse of their personal lives. In her narration component, Beyonc\u00e9 includes phrases like, \"Baptize me. \u2026 If we\u2019re gonna heal let it be glorious\u201d and \u201c1,000 girls raise their arms,\u201d a message of empowerment and hope that incorporates religious terms. This song perfectly contrasts to the rest of the album, providing almost a spiritual moment of relief in a storm of strong emotions.\r\n\r\n\"Freedom\" is the stage of hope and is the epitome of female\u00a0empowerment as many strong women like Zendaya, Winnie Harlow and Ava Clarke are featured in this song. The song \"Forward\" is the resurrection stage and also has powerful imagery as the mothers of several black men who were killed in the last couple of years were are shown holding pictures of their loved ones. This strong message shows how Beyonc\u00e9 is willing to stand up for her beliefs in her music, making it clear that this an issue calling out\u00a0for awareness and compassion.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll Night,\u201d the redemption stage shows many home video clips of\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s family as well as other unknown people and is a bittersweet ending to her visual album. This has a much more peaceful and lighter vibe as it shows Beyonc\u00e9 getting a matching \u201cfour\u201d tattoo with her husband Jay-Z, as well as letting the public in on their wedding night with\u00a0other couples who are unknown, smiling and having a good time together. All of these clips are happy, memorable events. It is a touching way to end her visual album as the song \"Formation\" is only featured in the end credits. She ends the song with \u201cHow I missed you my love\u201d in a haunting whisper.\r\n\r\nBeyonc\u00e9 uses this visual album as a platform to show her beliefs of women and black empowerment. However, the visual album has a much deeper message than a way of getting revenge on Jay-Z. It illustrates her versatility\u00a0as an artist: she can do anything from a touching slow song to a powerful, fast-paced pop song. However, the one complaint is that the songs are a bit repetitive, all over the place and not as cohesive because they seem to be there to supplement the visual aspect of the album. But this is Beyonc\u00e9 we're talking about \u2014 she can pull off any genre and make\u00a0the music as catchy as always.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Beyonce\u2019s visual album Lemonade has a meaningful message that goes beyond the topic of her husband.

We\u2019re seeing a trend across the nation of parents and students exercising that right.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to California Education Code \u00a760615, parents are allowed to let their children opt out of California standardized tests, such as the Smarter Balanced test, if the school's main office receives a handwritten note of excuse from parents.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Smarter Balanced Test is to measure the strength of a school\u2019s curriculum, according Diorio. In a recent email sent to juniors and their parents, Diorio encouraged students to take the test.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile the results of the test will not be included on your transcript and will not be used in the college admission process, the results will be used to assess the quality of our school and its programs,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nThere are several ramifications of a low participation rate, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn order to maintain our excellent rankings and strong reputation, both locally and nationally, it\u2019s important that we reach a 95 percent participation rate,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nIn addition to impacting the school\u2019s reputation, the tests can also help students, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe results from the Smarter Balance tests may be used to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Gold State Seal Merit Diploma, State Seal of Biliteracy and California State University's Early Assessment Program,\" Diorio said.\r\n\r\nJunior Michelle Leong is opting out of the test because she feels that it\u00a0would be a waste of time.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not want to take the Smarter Balanced test because I don\u2019t want to be at school for two days taking a test that seems irrelevant and not worth my time,\u201d Leong said.\r\n\r\nSenior Joseph Kao, who took the test last year, opted out after the first section of the exam.\r\n\r\n\"There was a section where they gave us two hours to finish a total of five questions, so it was kind of a waste of time,\u201d Kao said. \u201cIt was also a stressful period during junior year and I had a lot of work to do so I just decided to opt out. I knew a lot of people who were against the Common Core as well so that gave a different perspective on the whole testing situation.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, some students are still taking the test because it is a low-stakes assessment for them.\r\n\r\n\"I feel bad for opting out of a test that could provide valuable information for future students, especially since I have a younger sibling,\" junior Alan Huang said. \"It's actually not that much time compared to how much time I waste usually and I don't have much homework due after AP [Advanced Placement]\u00a0testing anyways.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Administration aims to increase student attendance for the state-standardized Smarter Balanced test that juniors will take on Tuesday and Wednesday at Paly.\r\n\r\n","date":"2016-05-16 18:45:20","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Screen-Shot-2015-04-27-at-4.26.04-PM.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["admin","diorio","improve","palo alto high","paly","participation rate","smarter balance test"]},{"id":120434,"title":"Paly Voices: Marie Davis","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/16\/paly-voices-marie-davis\/","content":"This is the first installment of the series \"Paly Voices,\" which showcases art by Palo Alto High School students.

[\/caption]\r\nThe Palo Alto High School baseball team (23-5-1, 12-2) defeated the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (20-12, 13-1), 3-2, thanks to a three-run rally in the final inning of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League championship game on Friday at Los Gatos.\r\n\r\nSophomore starting pitcher Jeremy Akioka held the Wildcats to just one run in five and one-third innings pitched, giving up his lone run in the third inning. Akioka said the team stayed strong despite trailing for most of the game.\r\n\r\n\"Our team did a great job of battling from behind and getting the hits when it mattered,\" Akioka said.\r\n\r\nDown 2-0, the Vikings were unable to score off Los Gatos' starting ace until the seventh and final inning where they sparked a three run rally.\r\n\r\nThis unlikely comeback started with a walk of senior Justin Hull, followed by a deep double off the right field wall by sophomore second baseman Max Jung-Goldberg. A pair of singles by seniors Alec Olmstead and Lawrence Han scored both Hull and Jung-Goldberg.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings finally took the lead off of a beautiful bunt by junior pinch-hitter Michael Champagne, which scored Olmstead from third.\r\n\r\nChampagne said the Vikings defense, specifically their pitching, enabled the offense to make a comeback late in the game and hopes the team can carry its momentum into the Central Coast Section playoffs.  \r\n\r\n\"Our pitching helped keep us in the game and we finally came alive in the 7th and had a great rally to take the lead,\" Champagne said. \"Niko Lillios provided a clutch closing inning to seal the victory. If our team can bottle that intensity we hope to have a far run in CCS.\"\r\n\r\nSophomore relief pitcher Niko Lillios sealed the game by forcing two flyouts and a strikeout.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will move on to compete in the CCS playoffs in the coming weeks The game time, opponent, and location have not yet been decided.\r\n\r\nAccording to Akioka, the team looks to continue its hot streak into the next round.\r\n\r\n\"We're confident that we will be able to use our momentum to push far through CCS this year,\" Akioka said.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School baseball team (23-5-1, 12-2) defeated the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (20-12, 13-1) 3-2, thanks to a three-run rally in the final inning of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League championship game on Friday at Los Gatos.","date":"2016-05-15 19:40:38","author":"Noah Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SCVAL-champs.jpg","categories":["Baseball","Sports","Spotlight","Uncategorized"],"tags":["Baseball","CCS","gatos","Jung-Goldberg","Lillios","niko","palo alto","rally","schoeben","scval","viking","win"]}]
