Larson is nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her captivating\u00a0performance as a woman kidnapped for seven years. Photo: A24 films.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to imagine living in just one room for seven years. It\u2019s even harder to imagine turning the survival story of the woman held captive and the coming-of-age story of her son into a successful, uplifting movie. Instead of portraying a tragedy as yet another emotionally draining drama, \u201cRoom\u201d manages to find hope in the horrifying, resulting in a powerful film that carries the weight necessary to contend with the other great works in its Oscars nomination category.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cRoom,\u201d based on the New York Times bestselling book of the same title by Emma Donoghue, tells the story of 17-year-old Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) who is kidnapped and held in a shack for seven years by her kidnapper Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). In that time, she gives birth to a boy named Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and raises him to the best of her ability, teaching him that their garden shed, Room, is all there is to the world. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the highlights and unique features of the movie is the fact that it is narrated by 5-year-old Jack. His innocent perspective not only provides optimism in a bleak situation, but also depth as he explains how Room is his world, and humor as he explains how aliens control heaven and birth. For such a young child actor, the depth of emotion accurately portrayed is nothing short of amazing. His dialogue is\u00a0also carefully constructed, taking into consideration how Jack bases his whole existence off one room. The outside world is simply \u201cspace\u201d and his disbelief in the existence of things like dogs and trees is communicated through his anger and fear manifesting in a tantrum and the words \u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d In other scenes, however, Jack plays with the childlike abandon shared by all 5-year-olds, resulting in a compelling character able to tie innocence and joy to what is by all accounts a nightmare.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Lenny Abrahamson, also nominated for an Oscar, utilizes camera angles and lighting to full effect. When Jack sees outside the room for the first time, the glaring light hitting the camera matches what his sensitive eyes would see. When he\u2019s crouched on the floor the camera also lowers, and when he\u2019s in argument with his mother the close-up facial shots convey the smallest changes in emotion. One issue with Abrahamson\u2019s use of the camera is that at certain times it feels overly realistic. Shaky cameras, when used in moderation, add to the performance, but in excess make the scene overwhelming for the wrong reasons.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all aspects of the movie, a clear effort to strip away the glamour of the traditional Hollywood drama is apparent: ordinarily beautiful Larson appears limp and pallid in soiled costumes, Old Nick is a rationalizing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, unemployed middle-aged man instead of the stereotypically violent aggressor, and Jack is not completely oblivious to the injustice of his situation despite his misunderstanding of the outside world. The movie gains gravitas from choosing to present moments that show this honesty, like shots of Jack listening to his mother\u2019s interactions with Old Nick at night, instead of the more stylized sequences often favored by other dramas.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the beautiful parts of the movie is\u00a0that the director does not\u00a0rely on dramatic music to make his points, and instead lets silence illustrate emotion. In one particular scene, as Joy contemplates the risk of her escape plan, her face, the rhythm of her breathing and her tightly clenched fists say it all.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Larson\u2019s performance is outstanding. Her character radiates the fierce maternal love so crucial to Jack\u2019s protection through the smallest glance or shift in tone. Her role encompasses nearly the entire range of human emotion in one film, and Larson meets each shift with underplayed intensity. From the very first opening shot, the audience is rooting for her, and though nothing like Joy\u2019s sacrifices are\u00a0experienced by Larson, Larson\u2019s character remains stunningly believable throughout the film.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, \u201cRoom\u201d is a film about perspective. As Jack and Ma lean on each other through their extreme escape, they realize the power of love and hope. Their ability to find the humor and excitement in everything, and their experience of looking at the world with fresh eyes is a valuable lesson in enjoying the little moments in life. \u201cRoom\u201d is a powerful, out of the box film about our ability to survive and adapt when all we have is love.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>\u201cRoom\u201d<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>1 hour, 58 minutes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Release Date: 16\u00a0October\u00a02015<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Rated: R\u00a0for language<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Directed by\u00a0Lenny Abrahamson<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Starring:\u00a0Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridgers<\/b>","excerpt":"Instead of turning a tragedy into yet another emotionally draining drama, \u201cRoom\u201d manages to find hope in the horrifying, creating a powerful film that carries the weight necessary to contend with the other great works in its Oscars category.","date":"2016-02-11 18:04:36","author":"Maya McNealis","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Room-2015-Lenny-Abrahamson-01-1024x614.jpg","categories":["Oscars 2016","Spotlight"],"tags":["best actress","brie larson","jacob tremblay","oscars","room"]},{"id":116185,"title":"Democrats to face off in debate","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/11\/democrats-to-face-off-in-debate\/","content":"Join The Paly Voice as we liveblog the Democratic debate between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders tonight at 6 p.m. on PBS.\r\n\r\n[liveblog]","excerpt":"Join The Paly Voice as we liveblog the Democratic debate between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders tonight at 6 p.m.","date":"2016-02-11 17:39:13","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/demdebate.jpg","categories":["News","Uncategorized"],"tags":["Bernie","Bernie Sanders","Clinton","Deabte","democrats","Hillary","Hillary Clinton","liveblog","Presidential race","Sanders"]},{"id":116058,"title":"Wrestling to attend SCVAL tournament this weekend","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/11\/wrestling-to-attend-scval-tournament-this-weekend\/","content":"<div class=\"gmail_default\">\n[caption width=\"614\" id=\"attachment_116136\" align=\"aligncenter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.57.57-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-116136\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.57.57-PM.png\" alt=\"Freshman Callum Day-Ham knocks down his opponent at the dual meet against Gunn on Thursday.

Their chemistry and passionate\u00a0performances create\u00a0a movie truly worth Best Actress, Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. Photo: Fox Searchlight Pictures.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A touching immigrant story that transports audiences into 1950s New York, \u201cBrooklyn\u201d is a romantic drama, filled with rich history and emotion. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The storyline, based on Colm Toibin\u2019s 2009 novel \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d tells the tale of Ellis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan), a young Irish woman who immigrates to New York. There, she faces the same struggle as the millions of immigrants that traveled to the United States, which is the need to assimilate to an unfamiliar way of life and the melancholy yearning for a faraway home with no hopes of returning. Ellis begins to enjoy her life in New York more when she falls for a friendly Italian-American plumber, Tom (Emory Cohen). However, after Ellis visits her hometown, she is faced with temptations from a local, Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson), and is torn between the two lovers.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viewers easily connect with the protagonist and are engrossed by Lacey\u2019s captivating journey to overcome\u00a0alienation in a new, unfamiliar environment.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director John Crowley takes the audience through the complexities of each character and lets the actors in the film shine. Every performance is full of emotion and evokes a sense of nostalgia. Ronan, Irish-born herself, delivers a stunning performance that quickly captures the heart of the audience. Ronan\u2019s character Lacey begins her journey as someone shy and inexperienced in the real world, and we see her grow into her true self throughout the movie. However, this inner transformation is subtle, for Ronan\u2019s character is not a fearless, larger than life heroine, but instead a very real woman struggling to find her place in the world. With\u00a0quiet strength and determination, Ronan is able to captivate the audience and bring the story of Ellis Lacey to life. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The costumes are\u00a0very well selected and do an exemplary job of enhancing the setting of the era. In particular,\u00a0in the scene at Coney Island, Lacey and Tom both wear\u00a0baggy, bright colored swimsuits authentic to the time period.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although \u201cBrooklyn\u201d has a large number of outstanding elements, the character development is generally lacking in the supporting cast. There is little insight into the life of the other characters in the story. Even with the sincerity and kindness of \u00a0Cohen\u2019s character, he remains largely two-dimensional despite being the main love interest. This is primarily\u00a0due to Crowley\u2019s intentions to illustrate small moments in the main character's life. However, there is\u00a0little to no insight into\u00a0the other characters in the story, although it clearly builds the potential for further development.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cBrooklyn\u201d feels like the result of a grandchild\u2019s inquiry into her ancestors. As a drama, it\u00a0paints a gritty and touching look into one young woman\u2019s journey.

My goal is to go into all the social science courses so that every senior touches this product before he or she leaves.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through their tutorials and visits, the librarians hope to familiarize students with One Search Discovery's many features, according to Kellerman. <\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cIn addition to searching, you can also filter specifically for books in the library, e-books and books published within a certain date range,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIf you are at home, you can also access the database through the library libguide. The nice thing about the e-books is that you can search for specific words in the books and the e-books aren't one to one, so the whole class could be looking at the same book. Furthermore, you can create folders, save books and access them anywhere, it\u2019s very much like a Google Drive environment.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the school's contract with its previous research tool expired, the librarians had been looking for a new system that could make research faster. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe old system for searching was very, very slow,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIf you needed a book, you would have to go to the library catalog, then if you wanted a database article you would have to go the library libguide, then if you wanted an e-book you would have to go the e-book catalog. Nothing was integrated. The old library system that we had was\u00a0more designed for middle school students.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the librarians hope that this new tool will help prepare students for college research.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSimilar search tools to One Search Discovery are found in colleges and universities,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to use, but like a new app on your phone it's good to practice before you have pressure for a research report and we wanted to expose students to it beforehand.\u201d \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Kellerman, the adoption of the One Search Discovery tool is representative of Paly\u2019s willingness to innovate and explore. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe're one of the high school that vendors [of software] will look at because we will try things out,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIn the spring we\u2019re going to a user's conference day that mostly has colleges, but we\u2019ve been invited because Paly really has that forward looking attitude.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the librarians discovered One Search Discovery last year, it has taken around nine months to get it up and running and they\u2019re still some areas which need to be improved. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou still need to click through a couple pages to access the text for the e-book,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cAnd some research tools like The New York Times and ABC Cleo aren\u2019t integrated.\u201d \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student reaction has been positive so far,\u00a0according to Kellerman. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe best reactions I got were \u2018I found it!\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m going to use it.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Alice On\u2019s opinion reflects Kellerman\u2019s view. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d On said. \u201cI tried it in my AP Psych class and there were some glitches, but other than that, it\u2019s pretty cool and convenient. It\u2019s like the entire library on your computer, I think I\u2019ll use it in the future.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Library recently launched its One Search Discovery Tool in an effort to streamline research.","date":"2016-02-08 11:48:23","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/photo.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["faster","Kellerman","one search discovery","paly","research","streamline"]}]
