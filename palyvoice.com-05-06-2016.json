It\u2019s a tad late to cram for that physics final.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo that, I have two answers. First of all, it\u2019s never too late to cram. If highschool has taught me anything at all, it\u2019s that.\r\n\r\nSecond, and perhaps the more profound point I wish to make, is that Newton\u2019s First Law extends far beyond the constraints of blocks resting on inclined planes.\r\n\r\nAllow me to elaborate.\r\n\r\nHigh school is an enigma. There\u2019s an overabundance of analogies I could use to describe high school \u2013 I could call it a jungle, a football game, a small country, and I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s some conceivable relationship I could draw between high school and a pudding cup, but the truth is that none of them fully capture the complexities of high school.\r\n\r\nBetween learning everything from oxidation numbers to correct condom usage, meeting everybody from Shakespeare reincarnated to some interesting hybrid of a gorilla and an armored tank, and dealing with everything from asking that one girl out to asking that one teacher to round you up, it\u2019s safe to say that high school is quite a beast.\r\n\r\nYet, we slayed it. We smote this beautiful, demented, son of a \u2013, wait, there are kids here. My bad, let\u2019s keep this PG.\r\n\r\nBeing the deep, transcendental thinker than I am, I sat on that safety hazard that we call a senior deck many a 5th period (sorry Ms. Angell) pondering this extraordinary feat. Hordes of freshman pour into this school, year after year, conquer these four years, and rise as unrivaled Vikings on the other side. What mysterious force could be behind this phenomenon?\r\n\r\nLove.\r\n\r\nJust kidding. That would be way too cheesy, even for a graduation speech.\r\n\r\nForgive me if my actual answer isn\u2019t quite as enlightening or game-changing as I built it up to be, but the simple answer is \u201cbecause we had to\u201d. Whether it be our parents, our friends, or some esoteric notion that finishing high school yields some marginal benefit, every single one of my green-clad classmates over there had something holding them onto high school.\r\n\r\nThis reason, this driving force, leaves us with no option but to dive into the belly of the beast. I don\u2019t know if I can speak for everyone, but I can confidently say anywhere inside the gastric system of any beast is far outside of my comfort zone. That venn diagram has zero overlap.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the crux of what I wish to leave my classmates with \u2013 ditching the comfort zone. The microenvironment of high school constantly pushed us outside of our comfort zone, whether in the form of a difficult subject, a social encounter, or an idea we didn\u2019t quite agree with.\r\n\r\nThis push is the \u2018external force\u2019 in Newton\u2019s First Law that I mentioned before. Our minds aren\u2019t designed to passively grow. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t just leave our brains in a jar out in the sunlight for four years, and expect to undergo the transformation we have from our freshman to our senior year. In order to evolve as people, in the tremendous ways that we all have during the incredible journey of high school, we need to be pushed outside of our comfort zone \u2013 into the danger zone, if you will.\r\n\r\nAs we move on into the various walks of life, that external force will begin to fade. We will no longer be held captive in an environment in which our teachers and peers force us to grow. Complacency will tempt us and the comfort of habit, routine, and familiarity will draw us like moths to a flame. To everyone who finds themselves giving into this temptation, just note down this one mental picture:\r\n\r\nImagine yourself on the first day of freshman year, bubbling with enthusiasm and head chock full of clich\u00e9d notions of what lay ahead.\r\n\r\nDisgusting, right?\r\n\r\nNow imagine that same kid, sitting here in your cap and gown, graduating high school. Unchanged, unaltered, except maybe a bit taller (unless you\u2019re me, and you stopped growing in 7th grade).\r\n\r\nScary, right? I think I just saw my entire class collectively cringe. I hope I don\u2019t sound too Silicon Valley when I say this, but progress really is the only way forward.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d actually like to make a small modification to Newton\u2019s First Law. Everyone makes mistakes, after all, right Mr. Stern? Even good old Isaac. Here it is:\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter an object graduates high school, it will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an internal force.\u201d\r\n\r\nBe your own internal force. Push yourself into new situations, explore new ideas, and learn new things about yourself. I\u2019ve already started. I gave this speech.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go Vikes.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice\u00a0acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

Well class, we started from the bottom, and now the whole team is here, ready to graduate high school. Today is the day to celebrate our journey and accomplishments as individuals and as a class. It seems like it was just yesterday that we experienced our freshman orientation, \u00a0first football game, first spirit week, and even the first streak week. Through our four year journey together, we have grown both physically and mentally. Our class has undeniably been one of the most successful graduating classes to walk through Palo Alto High School. This year, our athletic department has had 11 college athlete recruits, and has won many notable titles. Our various student organizations and clubs have flourished, and proudly represented our school, winning countless awards over the last four years. However, our years at Palo Alto High School were no walk in the park. Each and every one of us has experienced our fair share of disappointments and obstacles that we\u2019ve had to overcome. Through our years together, there is no doubt in my mind that this class is resilient. We survived the streak week ban, mandatory tutorial check-ins, and no food in the library rules. But in all seriousness, our grade has risen above the obstacles, and has become one united class, win together, lose together, classmates. The fact that we stand here decorated with awards, accomplishments\u00a0and knowledge is just a testament to our commitment to excellence and success. Graduates, you have all grown to be powerful and intellectual individuals who are destined for greatness. Street poet and philosopher Drake once said, \u201cLook at where I landed, You would think I planned it, I\u2019m just doing me, You could never understand it,\u201d. Things might not always go the way you planned, but being a part of the class, I know that each and every one of you is capable of making life the best you can. After all, it is the journey that often teaches you about your destination. As we move forward from our days at Paly, I ask that you live life the way you want to, do what makes you proud, because \u201cyou only live once\u201d. Graduates, strive to be the best version of yourself and remain fearless because you are viking. Right now, I\u2019d like to take the time to give thanks to our amazing teachers, warm guidance department, my family, and most importantly, all of <\/span><b>you<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in caps and gowns. In the words of one well-known hip-hop producer,\u201cWe da best.\u201d Congratulations to the brave, the bold, and the beautiful class of 2016, let\u2019s get it, let\u2019s go. <\/span>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice\u00a0acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

When I arrived at 9:30 the next morning, I uncomfortably noticed that I was the only male in the class and the only person under 60 in the entire building. During the next hour and a half, I received cramps in places I had never experienced. Even though I prided myself on having a diverse array of interests and being in shape, I was not expecting yoga to be so hard.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">You may know me as the co-president of the Jewish Student Union, a rapper, or the French curly haired senior who shaved his head for no apparent reason. You may be wondering, what qualifies me to give you a speech? I have lived in prosperous Palo Alto my whole life, and I realize that I have had a truly blessed childhood. People are perplexed anytime I complain, saying that students like you and me don't recognize how fortunate we are to attend Paly. Well, I understand people in Syria are grateful just to be alive, and that we're sitting here complaining about having chromebooks instead of Macbooks. This does not mean that even in our positions, with everything handed to us, we can't feel pressured at times. With so many life choices ahead of us, it is normal to be overwhelmed. Well, here is where I can help you.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The reason I told you about my painful yoga experience is that if I invited all of you to come to a yoga class this weekend, I\u2019m not sure how many of you would join me because the idea of attending a yoga class with 60 year old women may seem a bit odd and not worth your time. Well, you know what? After finishing the class, amid all the pain from that yoga, I felt renewed. I had explored something different, and that is an invaluable feeling. There are many activities during life for which you can say \u201cWhy would I try that\u201d? Well, I say : \u201cWhy not?\u201d During my four years at Paly, I have heard many students complain about the system, about how we are forced into schools with little freedom for exploration, and we are all coming out like robots. I have a solution. My antidote is why not? Try new things. We all have opportunities, but we usually avoid looking at them.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">After adopting this attitude, you know what? I feel the most liberated I have. Ever!<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Steve Jobs said \u201cwhy not?\u201d when he reinvented the computer. Elon Musk said \u201cwhy not?\u201d when he founded Tesla. So I challenge you.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Why not go to that yoga class? I will now be taking a gap year and spending three months at a Buddhist meditation temple.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Why not try out a new club that seems a bit different and maybe a bit scary? I joined the Jewish Student Union even though I am not Jewish, and this was one of the greatest decisions of my life.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I can tell you today that I am truly happy, and I am living my life to the fullest. We are all going on to bigger, better, things, but the one element that remains constant will be the options that we are given, and whether or not we choose to use them. Class of 2016, Paly has given us a springboard, and we have the privilege of using it. The next time that an opportunity outside your comfort zone arises, think twice.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I challenge you to say why not? And maybe I\u2019ll see you at a yoga class one of these days.

This is precisely why today I advocate for retaining the best qualities of childhood: curiosity, imagination, and living in the present.\r\n\r\nWhen we were children, our world was fascinating. We were captivated by clouds in the shape of dogs, trees, and planes, by static electricity that makes our hair stand on end, and by ants carrying bread crumbs nearly as big as themselves. To see what would happen, we may have committed mass murder by kicking in an anthill. Always eager for excitement, we dropped Mentos in a king-size Coke and then admired the foam shooting skyward. Such antics were not prompted in hopes of any specific reward; back then we weren\u2019t college-resume-building. No, we were simply curious\r\n\r\nWe not only closely observed our environment, we also wanted to disturb it. Curiosity got Isaac Newton cogitating about the fallen apple and then deriving the law of gravity. Curiosity made Benjamin Franklin contemplate lightning, leading him to basic concepts about electricity. Recently, founders of Sushirrito Restaurant in Palo Alto must have pondered fusing Japanese sushi with Mexican burritos. Such triumphs suggest the benefits of retaining our curiosity and seeing where it leads us.\r\n\r\nAn essential guide is our imagination. The French scientist Louis Pasteur wanted to find the \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d that causes rabies. People repeatedly told him that since it was invisible, he wouldn\u2019t find it. Luckily for humanity, that didn\u2019t stop Pasteur, who imagined that organisms could be so small as to be invisible to the eye and saved countless lives. According to Albert Einstein, \u201cImagination is more important than knowledge.\u201d In fact, imagination often brings forth new knowledge and can catalyze change. Imagining that all people deserve rights and can contribute to society was essential for freeing slaves and giving the vote to women. Imagination led Nikola Tesla to combine telephony and computing, which has morphed into today\u2019s smartphone industry. Now, in the palm of our hands, we can learn everything from the Pythagorean Theorem to how many jumping jacks are required to burn calories from a Big Mac. (Pretend to tap, hold up phone) That answer, by the way, is 375. In school, too, imagination is precious. Learning U.S. history, we deepen our understanding when we imagine what life at the height of the Great Depression felt like for 25% of the labor force who were unemployed. Inevitably, we also imagined Mr. Jack Bungarden\u2019s disapproving expression as he read our scribbled responses to document-based questions. In AP Environmental Science, we envisioned the impact of rising sea levels and resource depletion on people and other life forms; we also recall Mr. Kenyon Scott\u2019s seemingly endless optimism and positivity, his legacy to each of us. After we leave Paly, let\u2019s take with us our imagination.\r\n\r\nAs children, we lived in the present. Remember telling us to save our Halloween candy? No way! As we grew up, we recognized we have a future, and we learned to plan ahead. In the fable \u201cThe Ant and the Grasshopper,\u201d the ant worked all summer long to store food for winter. All summer long, the carefree grasshopper sang, and, as winter approached, found itself hungry. We are trained to be ants. As high school students, many of us planned for college. As college students, we will plan for careers. When we work, we should save for retirement. I certainly don\u2019t praise procrastination, but sometimes we work so hard for and expect so much from what lies ahead that we miss our here and now. We should not make the mistake of living only for the future; after all, the time in which we truly live is the present, is now. As cartoonist Bil Keane put it, \u201cYesterday\u2019s the past, tomorrow\u2019s the future, but today is a gift. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the present.\u201d Let us always treasure the gift of today.\r\n\r\nChildhood is a time when we expanded our world, a time when we hadn\u2019t closed ourselves off or given up on our dreams, a time when we were very much alive. My hope for each of us here, whether you are 8 or 18 or 80 or more, is that, as we venture forth, we are curious and imaginative and live in the present. Thank you.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice\u00a0acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

A Verde story had taken a couple of other staffers and me to a coin wash on El Camino at 11 p.m. Two things struck me about my conversation with Reyna: the mistakes she had made in her life and the obvious love she had for her daughter, Eileen.\r\n\r\nReyna told me that in high school, she had gotten herself kicked out for fighting and was sent to Juvenile Hall. She was then incarcerated for a different offense as an adult several years later.\r\n\r\nAs she was telling me her story, I couldn\u2019t help but dwell on how much she had messed up. Her mistakes seemed unforgivable, a deal-breaker when it came to her character. But something changed when Reyna started talking about her daughter.\r\n\r\nShe described her 6-year-old daughter, Eileen, as \u201cpure, pure pink.\u201d According to Reyna, Eileen prefers spending her time watching \u201cAustin and Ally\u201d on the Disney Channel instead of listening to rap music.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe wants the other life, the life we see on TV, you know?\u201d Reyna said.\r\n\r\nAnd, as it turns out, Reyna is trying to give Eileen that life. She told me she\u2019s getting her GED. She\u2019s in the process of turning her life around because she knows she needs to get it together for her daughter.\r\n\r\nReyna owned up to making some irreversible mistakes. But despite the chaos of her past life, she was trying to do what was best for her daughter. She\u2019s doing everything she can to help her daughter get what she wants. She may not be perfect, but she has Eileen\u2019s best interests at heart.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement of finishing high school and, for some of us, moving away from home. But in these final weeks and months, as we transition to a different stage in our lives, I think it\u2019s important for us to reflect on who our Reynas are. Think about that person who has always been there for you and who always wants what\u2019s best for you. Maybe that person is just as flawed as, or even more flawed than Reyna. But what\u2019s really important, in the end, is recognizing and thanking that person for helping you get to where you are today.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year in Ms. Bartlett\u2019s English class, we read a short story by John Cheever called \u201cThe Swimmer.\u201d In the story, a man decides to swim across all of the pools in the county, which he collectively names The Lucinda River. The problem is that he is self-centered and he believes his swim to be one of great historical importance. He spurns the hospitality of many friends and neighbors during his journey. He eventually swims home, only to discover that his house is abandoned and his garden is overgrown. His family is nowhere to be found. He can\u2019t remember where they are. He becomes disillusioned with his great conquest of The Lucinda River and is full of regret and loneliness.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I worry about becoming the swimmer in the story. He spends so much time underwater, engrossed in his all-consuming illusions, that he forgets about what really matters: his family and the place he calls home. I worry about failing to swim with my head above water. I worry that, when I\u2019m away from them, I will be too wrapped up in my own Lucinda River to pay my family and friends from home the attention and love they so greatly deserve.\r\n\r\nTo me, my conversation with Reyna and reading of \u201cThe Swimmer\u201d serve as important reminders. A reminder that sometimes, the people who have always been there for you aren\u2019t perfect, and that that\u2019s okay.

This year, we are hoping that we will be able to introduce more kids to more aspects of STEAM on the paly robotics team. There are different sessions offered that cover subjects including robot design, robot hardware, Python programming, 3D animation with Autodesk Maya, website design, and business plan writing.

Photo: Julia Qiao[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAlthough they may not always train or play together, sophomore Michael Chau and junior Flavia Stiglich are connected by a deeper bond \u2013 their love for badminton.\r\n\r\nIn a short amount of time at Palo Alto High School, Stiglich and Chau have become close friends through their many discussions about their badminton experiences. Both are highly successful players: Chau is nationally ranked in the United States and Stiglich is a member of the Peruvian National Badminton Team.\r\n\r\nTogether, these newcomers have led Paly's badminton team to one of its best seasons in years, including successful showings at the California Interscholastic Federation Northern California Tournament over the weekend.\r\n\r\nChau and senior Eric Chiang placed third in the boys\u2019 double division at CIF-Norcal in San Jose, according to Chau. Senior Priya Misner and junior Stiglich also made it into quarterfinals before falling to a team from Carlmont. Chau and Chiang were seeded third heading into Saturday\u2019s tournament after placing second at Central Coast Section finals and first at Santa Clara Valley Athletic League, according to Chau.\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael Chau: Leader by example\r\n<\/strong>\r\n\r\nChau joined the Vikings this year and quickly helped lead the team to victory. Currently, he is ranked 32nd in the Under-19 age group for Boys' Singles. To be nationally ranked, players must compete in many USA Badminton tournaments. At his peak, Chau was ranked 19th in the nation is his age group playing Boys' Singles.\r\n\r\nChau's mother introduced him to the sport at the age of eight, hoping that he would play a sport that he could not get injured in. Having fallen in love with the sport, Chau has spent the last eight years practicing and honing his technique. He hopes to follow his passion and continue badminton far into the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy ultimate goal is to go to the Olympics, but I do not really know if that will happen,\u201d Chau said. \u201cIt seems really far away, but you have to dream to keep going.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeyond the national tournaments and Olympic dream, Chau has found his spot on Paly\u2019s badminton team. According to assistant coach Arne Lim, he was able to carry the team\u2019s spirit and boost its moral.\r\n\r\n\u201cMichael did not win every single time, yet every time he played, everyone watched him,\u201d Lim said. \u201cWe usually tried to set his match early in the tournament so it [his match] sets the tone for the team, because when he won, everyone said, \u2018Okay, we can do this.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nChau\u2019s talent is well known throughout the team and many members value his expertise.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is kind of a team leader without a title,\u201d Lim said. \u201cHe leads through example and skill. He is a nice guy and a very good team player as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Flavia Stiglich: Leader by teaching\r\n<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Vikings also saw the addition of member Flavia Stiglich, who moved from Peru in December 2015. Although she no longer practices with the Peruvian National Badminton Team, she still represents Peru in international competition, including the Pan American Junior Competition, which she has competed in since 2011, and the World Junior Championships, which she competed in since 2015. Stiglich also represents her country at many Southern American tournaments\u00a0and has been doing so since 2011.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best feeling is when I compete with other countries and compete for my country,\u201d Stiglich said. \u201cBecause then, you are no longer playing for yourself, but also for your country. When you win something, you are serving something bigger than yourself, and that feeling is something I just cannot describe.\u201d\r\n\r\nStiglich first started badminton at the age of 10, and after two years of practice, she decided to try out for the national badminton team in 2011. At first glance, it seems as though Stiglich\u2019s path has been relatively smooth, reaching national success after two years. However, Stiglich has had to overcome many barriers, the biggest being herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore the qualification for the World Junior Championships in 2015, I played a tournament to qualify to the 2015 South American Tournament and did not do as well as expected,\u201d Stiglich said. \u201cMy mental game was off ... so my game was not the level it should have been. During the time between the South American and Worlds qualifications, I had a tough time thinking that I was not going to make it to Worlds and that I was not good enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nStiglich admits that she thought about quitting badminton\u00a0but ultimately decided to continue working towards her goal.\r\n\r\n\u201cI learned to never give up on my dreams,\u201d Stiglich said. \u201cAfter working on my mental strength and confidence, I was able to overcome all the negative thoughts. When the World Junior Championship qualification tournament came around, I was ready to do my best and qualified to represent my country at the championships.\u201d\r\n\r\nLike Chau, Stiglich found her place on the team and soon became a valuable leader on and off the court.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is willing to teach others who are willing to listen,\u201d Lim said. \u201cShe is willing to take some time to root them on, to be part of the team and really support the women who are on our team. People like her a lot and she has got a wonderful personality. She has a very strong charisma that is poised and confident while not overbearing. ... She leads by her knowledge and help.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith Chau and Stiglich at the helm, the team will already have a strong start by the time the spring badminton season rolls around, despite assistant coach Arne Lim leaving.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe expect to have a great season next year,\u201d Lim said. \u201cFlavia is only a junior and Michael is only a sophomore, so they will be playing for us next year as well. We also have some people who are returning next year who took this year off, which will add to our team. It will be a season to watch out for.\u201d","excerpt":"Although they may not always train or play together, sophomore Michael Chau and junior Flavia Stiglich are connected by a deeper bond \u2013 their love for badminton.","date":"2016-05-26 22:31:03","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Flavia-and-michael.jpg","categories":["A&amp;E Section Spotlight","Badminton","Features","Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["#norcal","Arne Lim","badminton","CIF-Norcal","Flavia Stiglich","Michael Chau","paly","season recap","states"]},{"id":120671,"title":"School board representatives to obtain preferential vote","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/26\/school-board-representatives-to-obtain-preferential-vote\/","content":"Pending approval at a meeting in June,\u00a0Board of Education student\u00a0representatives will cast preferential votes during Palo Alto Unified School District board meetings\u00a0starting next school year.\r\n\r\nAccording to Supt. Max McGee, the policy will be\u00a0approved at the final board meeting of the school year on June 22, and representatives will begin casting preferential votes in the first board meeting of the next school year. The vote will be in response to a successful student petition calling for preferential votes, which received the required 400 signatures.\r\n\r\nUnlike the votes that school board members cast, preferential votes are not included in the vote\u00a0counts. However, the votes are recorded in the minutes and allow student representatives to take\u00a0an official stance on issues.\r\n\r\nJunior Gunn High School school board\u00a0representative Ankit Ranjan said\u00a0the preferential votes will increase transparency and avoid any miscommunication between the board and\u00a0the student body.\r\n\r\n\"[Junior school board representative] David [Tayeri] and I both care about increasing student involvement in district decision-making, and this is a great step toward that goal,\" Ranjan said. \"It allows us to take an unequivocal stance on issues and limit misinterpretation.\"\r\n\r\nTayeri and Ranjan created the petition calling for preferential votes, which the board is required to accept\u00a0with support from over 10 percent of the high school population under <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leginfo.ca.gov\/cgi-bin\/displaycode?section=edc&amp;group=35001-36000&amp;file=35010-35012\" target=\"_blank\">California Education Code 35012<\/a>.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ranjan, the petition easily received support from students, as well as community members.\r\n\r\n\"It was just waiting to happen,\" Ranjan said. \"Students generally supported the idea of improved student voice, board members were not opposed and there is legal basis.\"\r\n\r\nMcGee\u00a0said\u00a0the change to allow preferential votes is a huge step to advance student voice,\u00a0but sees the potential for more improvement.\r\n\r\n\"I think we can still do much more regarding student voice being heard,\" McGee said. \"I have some more plans that I will be sharing at our board retreat in June and announcing in August. One will be a student advisory board and one will be a variation on the policy commonly called 'Open Door' to an open outdoor one [office].\"\r\n\r\nTo ensure the preferential votes are representative of the entire student body, Tayeri said he plans\u00a0to encourage student involvement and communication.\r\n\r\n\"I strongly encourage students to attend school board meetings,\" Tayeri said. \"When students become more informed about the nature of the meetings and the issues being discussed, they can better take part in the discussion about where my vote will go.\u00a0I also encourage anyone with a question about a school board decision or upcoming ballot measure to contact me anytime.\"","excerpt":"Student school board representatives will cast preferential votes during board meetings starting next school year.","date":"2016-05-26 20:51:35","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_5454.jpg","categories":["Editor's Pick","News"],"tags":["McGee","preferential","School Board","school representative","student","vote"]},{"id":120718,"title":"Baseball season yields familiar results","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/26\/baseball-season-yields-familiar-results\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_121096\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"499\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/baseballlast.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-121096\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/baseballlast.jpg\" alt=\"Senior Alec Olmsted throws a fastball to a Los Gatos hitter.

They've got plenty of players to replace the ones they're losing and have a number of good JV players who will get some time.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the future season, sophomore division one baseball commit Max Jung-Goldberg said the Vikings will look to underclassmen to fill some of the roles of the graduating seniors.\r\n\r\n\"Next year we are going to be a young team,\" Jung-Goldberg said. \"But I think that a lot of the underclassmen will be able to step up and fill the roles that the seniors played this year.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to maxpreps.com, a high school sports website, individual highlights include Hull, who led the De Anza League in runs on offense and batters struck out, and second best earned run average on defense. Additionally, junior center fielder Ben Cleasby led the league in runs batted in.\r\n\r\nThe team will also greatly miss the production of six seniors: Hull, Riley Schoeben, Albert Han, Laurence Han, Owen Plambeck, and Alec Olmstead.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School baseball team's (23-6-1, 12-2) season came to a close after a loss to Valley Christian High School (16-15, 6-8) in the first round of the Central Coast Section playoff on Thursday, despite holding the number one seed.
