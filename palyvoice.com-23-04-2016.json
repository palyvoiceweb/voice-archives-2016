According to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson, construction workers in the Performing Arts Center accidentally triggered both alarms.\r\n\r\nThe first fire alarm went off before school started, forcing bewildered students to line up on the football field during the morning rain.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was raining outside and the construction workers didn\u2019t evacuate, so I was suspicious that a student pulled the alarm as a prank or to avoid their first period,\u201d junior Annabelle Hu said. \u201cI was pretty miserable in the rain. \u2026 It was a monumental waste of time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Gaby Pelayo was\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">recording a presentation in her third period Advanced Placement Spanish Language class when the fire alarm interrupted midway \u2014 ruining the recording.

All fire alarms are a hassle but considering the [AP] tests are around the corner, our classes need to be as productive as possible.\"\r\n\r\nWhile today\u2019s alarms were accidental occurrences, Paly is not a new victim of false alarms.

The person who did it clearly doesn't understand the hate that they're projecting and what damage they can do.\"\r\n\r\nThe graffiti appeared just as\u00a0Paly began its <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/17\/change-in-our-schools-week-cultivating-a-positive-community\/\">first annual Change In Our Schools Week<\/a>, intended\u00a0to celebrate student diversity and promote respect. Junior Cezanne Lane, an organizer of CIOS Week and Associated Student Body spirit commissioner,\u00a0was also\u00a0taken aback by the hateful comments.\r\n\r\n\"This is really shocking for a community that I thought was so progressive,\" Lane said. \"Hopefully the person who did it didn't mean it, but those words are harmful.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Dami Bolarinwa said he is disappointed by the graffiti. According to Bolarinwa, the Black Lives Matter movement carries an important message that people need to hear.\r\n\r\n\"That's truly heartbreaking to see that people have reverted to such disgrace of integrity,\" Bolarinwa said. \"Black lives and many minority lives are targeted, so it saddens me to know students at Paly feel that way and are continuing to target students on campus with vandalism as this.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Sergio Valente said he believes the messages do not represent the values of the Paly student body.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I saw the graffiti I assumed that the people who created it were just doing so as a joke and thought it was funny,\u201d Valente said. \u201cI think there are many better ways to express juvenile fun and it\u2019s sad that they chose to do so in a way that can be offensive. I also don\u2019t think that it is something that needs to be blown out of proportion as it was the actions of presumably a few individuals and need not reflect on the school as a whole.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Maya Lathi said she thinks that people have the right to express political opinions, but personal beliefs should be shared in ways other than graffiti.\r\n\r\n\"With regards to the 'Black Lives Suck' graffiti, I think it is sad to see that this is a view a fellow student has, but it shouldn't be considered representative of our tolerant student body,\" Lathi said.\u00a0\"In regards to the 'Trump 1237' graffiti, while I disagree with the politics of Donald Trump, I respect each citizen's right to believe in whatever politics they'd like to.\u00a0There are more respectful, less destructive, ways to express one's opinion than vandalism.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Reuben Kramer said he hopes people learn to value respect\u00a0and tolerance.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I think that it's embarrassing that someone would do a hate crime, especially on campus,\" Kramer said. \"I would encourage people to stand up to racism whenever they see it, because it has no place in this world.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nTrump\u00a0is scheduled to appear at the California Republican Party convention on Friday, April 29, in Burlingame. A protest to his speech is being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1524102991231738\/\" target=\"_blank\">organized through Facebook<\/a>, encouraging people to \"show him [Trump] a real Bay Area welcome by peacefully protesting outside.\" Several Paly students marked that they are planning to attend the protest.\u00a0The Trump\u00a0campaign, when contacted by The Paly Voice, indicated it would respond to news of the graffiti but had not done so as of 9:45 p.m. Monday\u00a0night.\r\n\r\nComparable graffiti has defaced other schools outside of Palo Alto, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/local\/education\/higher-ed\/la-me-ln-lmu-graffiti-20160406-story.html\">Loyola Marymount University<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/politics-government\/ci_29675931\/trump-graffiti-scares-emory-students-we-are-pain\">Emory University<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonherald.com\/news\/local_coverage\/2016\/03\/judge_s_son_charged_with_spray_painting_trump_and_racist_graffiti\">Northwestern University,\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dispatch.com\/content\/stories\/local\/2016\/04\/16\/pro-trump-message-on-wall-sparks-discourse-at-ou.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ohio University<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/laist.com\/2016\/03\/14\/pacific_palisades_racist_graffiti.php\">Pacific Palisades Charter High School<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<em>Additional reporting and writing by Emily Hwang.<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Editor\u2019s Note: For a few minutes, an extension on one of our editors' browser changed all mentions of \u201cTrump\u201d to \u201cDrumpf.\u201d We apologize\u00a0for this brief departure from correct spelling.<\/em>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School administration is investigating racist and pro-Donald Trump graffiti messages discovered on campus this morning.","date":"2016-04-18 21:48:09","author":"Bianca Al-Shamari","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/trump-graffiti.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["graffiti","messages","racist","Trump","vandalism"]},{"id":118754,"title":"Library to provide finals studying for students","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/18\/library-to-provide-finals-studying-for-students\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_73571\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"503\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_0783.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-73571\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_0783.jpg\" alt=\"People will have plenty of room to experience the Mitchell Park Library\u2019s new features thanks to the building\u2019s massive size.

We\u2019ll be open until 10 p.m. on May 25 and 26.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne new feature\u00a0the library will be offering this year is a special quiet study room, according to Martinez.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis year, we are planning to have the Adobe Room be an extra large designated quiet room for those who study best solo,\u201d Martinez said.\r\n\r\nIn addition to study space, the Mitchell Park Library will be providing teens with other resources, according to Martinez.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will also be offering snacks and free games during your breaks from studying,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cStudents can take a break in the Teen Center to play on the WiiU, Xbox One, board games, air hockey and ping-pong tables. Therapy dogs will be visiting the library to de-stress, too.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrining in therapy dogs have been successful in the past, according to Martinez.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a request from one teen back in December who told me she had been looking forward to Finals Cram Slam just so she could see and get a visit from our therapy dogs,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cFrom the moment she saw one of our pups she was smiling from ear to ear, and it is a good feeling to know we are helping students de-stress. The Mitchell Park Library and Community Center care a lot about our youth, and we are always striving to keep them happy, even while studying, when they are here.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_119329\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"387\"]<img class=\"wp-image-119329\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/photo.jpg\" alt=\"photo\" width=\"387\" height=\"290\" \/> This year, the library and its student leadership team, the Teen Library Advisory Board, are hoping to increase student wellness during finals through their 'Post-its for Positivity' project, according to Martinez.
