People either love it or hate it for existing outside the black-and-white world. It only takes a few fishbowls and Socratic Seminars to see that it\u2019s often just as easy to prove the converse of a theme using slightly different evidence. Still, exploring all the avenues available to find the hidden meaning in a text can be\u00a0rewarding.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As such, English is a class that is inherently subjective. When analyzed under different rubrics, the same work gets different credit. Distorted by layers of partiality, from interpretation to writing style to a teacher\u2019s own opinion of a thesis, we feel that at Palo Alto High School, equality before the gradebook is not a sufficiently enforced policy. In short, the differences in grading and expectations in English classes at\u00a0Paly are detrimental to students and ultimately result in inaccurate representations of both talent and effort. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we get into the horizontal and vertical alignment alluded to above, we\u2019d like to clarify something. We do not intend to call out any specific English teacher in this article, and we don\u2019t believe any of these teachers are consciously biased. We are extremely grateful to all our English teachers for everything they\u2019ve taught us, from the x-y-z\u2019s of thesis writing to the MLA format of a final paper. The Paly faculty is a passionate, talented group of teachers who all want their students to succeed. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if students are to succeed, Paly needs to have a new policy enforcing alignment, so that every student is given an equal opportunity to learn and excel. Additionally, this kind of adaptation to Paly\u2019s current alignment efforts would also help fulfill the most recent <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/22\/wasc-team-announces-results-of-self-study-report\/\">WASC goals<\/a>\u00a0of systems alignment, student engagement and innovation in the\u00a0English department.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horizontal alignment is the educational practice of ensuring that students taking the same course under different teachers are still learning the same material. This doesn\u2019t solely mean they read similar literature, but that they are taught the same writing techniques and organizational formats. Vertical alignment holds teachers accountable for adequately preparing their students to succeed in the next level course, meaning\u00a0that if a junior year course is open to both regular and honors sophomore students, both should be able to effectively complete the course junior year.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/english-horizontal-alignment.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-120858\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/english-horizontal-alignment.jpeg\" alt=\"english-horizontal-alignment\" width=\"800\" height=\"490\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine this scenario. You read the required book for your class, and after discussions and analysis, you receive an essay prompt, the prompt given to all students in your lane. You write an essay, using the instructions given to you by your teacher. Then you add it to the pile of essays for a different teacher teaching a different period of the same class. Would you be confident your work would get the grade it deserved? Would you bet 10 or 15 or 20 percent of your grade on it? We wouldn\u2019t.\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What isolates English as the least horizontally aligned subject is the lack of common material shared between classes. In STEM classes, differences between two teachers can be frustrating, but at least students have a common textbook or common notes. Reading the same book in two different classes does not guarantee the same knowledge, as the material used to analyze the book can completely change your perspective of the literature.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly\u2019s current departmental policy requires that English teachers hold bimonthly grade-level meetings to discuss how credit should be awarded in each class and other aspects of student learning. Instructional Supervisor Shirley Tokheim finds the grade-level teams to be useful in facilitating cohesion. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen we have collaboration, teachers meet in their grade-level teams and ... talk about creating common assessments, creating a common syllabus \u2026 and [calibrating] essays,\u201d Tokheim said. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite acknowledging room for improvement, Tokheim feels that alignment is not an issue that can be corrected quickly. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s something that takes years and years .\u2026 It\u2019s something that you\u2019re constantly working on and something that our department is constantly working on,\u201d Tokheim said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, we feel that this approach is too passive for such a pervasive problem within the English department. The fact that certain teachers within the same lane are infamous for their intense discussion groups or their emphasis on participation screams inconsistency. Teachers have their own style, and we value learning to adapt to different learning methods, but in past courses we\u2019ve compared our assignments to find completely different resources and templates available. The difference between the basic writing materials provided to us can only mean that our writing is graded differently. The fact that colleges will see the same course on our transcripts, when in actuality our courses are far from the same, is not okay. It\u2019s pretty misleading.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English teacher Julia Taylor cautions that complete uniformity is a dangerous goal when it comes to English alignment.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn English class we have to be really careful because there is a way to take alignment a little bit too far,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhen all the teachers decide that they\u2019re going to be using the exact same terminology \u2026 \u00a0it\u2019s a little problematic because what happens when students go to colleges all over the place and someone uses different terminology? The students don\u2019t have flexibility of thinking.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We feel that there must be a way to achieve this flexibility of thinking while maintaining consistency between classes. English is meant to be a creative subject, but there are ways to find a balance between\u00a0creativity\u00a0and structure. As a first step, we suggest all potential biases are eliminated from the gradebook. We invite teachers to try our scenario above, and adopt Advanced Placement Psychology\u2019s policy of identifying written work by student ID, not name. We personally do not think teachers are biased against students, but this method would prevent students from blaming grades on subjectivity, instead initiating a conversation about what\u2019s actually wrong with poorly graded work.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grades aren\u2019t the only thing hurt by insufficient vertical alignment. Psychology shows that a student\u2019s self-esteem, their confidence in their ability, and their intrinsic motivation to succeed are all damaged when they\u2019re thrown into a class unprepared. Ninth grade English teacher Mimi Park explains that this problem is being tackled in the form of Thursday collaborations between the ninth and 10th\u00a0grade levels.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/english-vertical-alignment.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-120865\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/english-vertical-alignment.jpeg\" alt=\"english-vertical-alignment\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n\u201cWith ninth and 10th\u00a0grade discussions, and really this is all I can speak to just on personal experience, we have meetings where\u00a0we talk about expectations and the transition from ninth grade to 10th grade, the skill sets that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Park said.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we applaud the department\u2019s increasing focus on vertical alignment, this focus seems to be struggling to reach the 11th\u00a0and 12th\u00a0grade classes, years with a particularly significant increase in academic rigor. If collaboration in these teacher teams is more difficult, we suggest a set of uniform handouts to set expectations between lanes. A teacher could then prepare students for next year, teaching a few lessons in advance, the same way some math classes spend the last weeks of school going over materials that will be seen in next year\u2019s lane.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While most teachers seem to be working towards goals of alignment, an increase of student feedback could help them get there. Right now, mandatory end-of-year surveys question a single teacher\u2019s skills, but rarely touch on the alignment between classes in the same lane or reflections of students\u2019 satisfaction with their previous class\u2019 preparation for their course. Teachers should do more than just look at the responses to these surveys; there should at least be a department meeting to discuss the results. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We attribute some of these alignment issues to flaws in the department\u2019s solicitation of student feedback. Some of the burden is on students to actually provide constructive feedback instead of just venting. We also suspect that part of the difficulty\u00a0stems from teachers' resistance to examine criticism, and part of it comes from the logistical challenges of collecting this kind of feedback.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, inconvenient truths can only be faced when they come with a side of data, and we hope that the upcoming end-of-year survey is used to evaluate not only individual performance, but the orchestrations of the department as a whole. Alignment may require trial and error, from trying out student IDs on essays to improving\u00a0standardized grade-level expectations, but we believe the Paly English department will handle it well. After all, if there is one thing that English has\u00a0taught\u00a0us, it's that the best work always needs multiple drafts.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"Imagine this scenario.

Photo by Nika Woodfill.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis week the Paly Voice sat down with music enthusiast and Vikapella member senior Jenny Xin, to discuss pop music, her perfect pitch and choir.\r\n\r\nXin has participated in choir for all four years of high school, but claims it has not influenced her music taste substantially, despite its importance to her musical education.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy music taste is independent from choir,\u201d Xin said. \u201cHowever, choir has exposed me to a lot of new ideas musically, and stylistically, and I\u2019ve kind of learned what makes the songs I like listening to catchy. And kind of been able to learn about popular music throughout the ages. Even though I don't listen to a lot of the songs we sing in choir it is definitely really interesting to learn about them and perform and that has definitely broadened my musical horizons.\u201d\r\n\r\nOver the course of Xin\u2019s musical career, she has been able to develop something called perfect pitch.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo perfect pitch is generally like being a glorified tuning fork,\u201d Xin said. \u201cBasically perfect pitch or relative pitch means just being able\u00a0to identify notes by their name, so if you hear the letter C or E or A flat you'll be able to hear that note in your head.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the talent that stems from having perfect pitch, Xin explains that it is more of an annoyance when it comes to listening to music.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gets kind of annoying. It\u2019s not really a help as much as it is a giant pain,\u201d Xin said. \u201cI\u2019ll listen to a radio station and sometimes they'll pitch their songs to avoid copyright issues and so I can kind of realize that it annoys me the whole time.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Xin, she most enjoys listening to high tempo upbeat songs, however, her individual music taste is difficult to categorize.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of the songs I listen to are so different I'm not really sure what the underlying theme is,\u201d Xin said.\" For me, it is to an extent lyrical but also the production behind the song. But mostly I tend to like really upbeat catchy music.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Xin described how her music preference has evolved in high school.\r\n\r\n\u201cI used to think listening to mainstream pop was kind of a guilty pleasure thing, but I think I enjoy more now without too much shame, and I have gotten more into musicals,\u201d Xin said. \u201cMy music taste has definitely developed. Before I would mostly be listening to classical or pop music but now I listen to everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aclairekrugler%3Aplaylist%3A3Z3oH0xrxcXRUJQij2AQbv\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"This week the Paly Voice sat down with music enthusiast and Vikapella member senior Jenny Xin, to discuss pop music, her perfect pitch and choir. <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/24\/tuesday-tunes-jenny-xin\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2016-05-24 23:31:31","author":"Claire Krugler","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/DSC_00081.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Spotlight","Tuesday Tunes"],"tags":["choir","Jenny Xin","music","perfect pitch","Tuesday Tunes","vikapella","wombats"]},{"id":120788,"title":"Students to perform music on the Quad during lunch","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/24\/students-to-perform-music-on-the-quad-during-lunch\/","content":"Student musicians will be performing on the Palo Alto High School Quad during lunch\u00a0as part of this week's program hosted by the Associated Student Body.\r\n\r\nThe performances will include\u00a0original pieces and covers, according to ASB School Board representative senior Emma Cole.

Students\u00a0from a variety of musical backgrounds signed up to perform in front of their peers and show off their talent.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis week\u00a0gave us a reason to get a group together and try playing some styles of music we do not usually play,\u201d senior Peter Willits said. \u201cWe are using this week of music as a method to spread some music to people who may need it and hopefully to get some people dancing.\u201d\r\n\r\nWillits and his band will be playing covers of reggae, ska and funk songs.\r\n\r\nOther hope that this week will help bring some publicity to their work.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to perform because I have been writing and producing original songs for years and want this to help me get more exposure,\u201d senior Martin Manasherob said. He will be performing a series of\u00a0hip-hop and rhythm and blues songs, all self-written and produced.\r\n\r\nManasherob says he hopes\u00a0that his music will help students relax and have fun.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that this will be good for the campus because it is music that gives off a good vibe,\u201d Menasherob said. \u201cIt [the music] is positive for people who might be having a tough day or maybe just want to enjoy some good music.\u201d\r\n\r\nBelow is the tentative list of performance dates, according to Cole. Dates are subject to change.\r\n\r\nMay 20: Russell Star-lack and Jer Samos (\"RAJ\")\r\n\r\nMay 23: Peter Willits\r\n\r\nMay 24: Clara Chiu and Claire Krugler (first half), Martin Manasherob (second half)\r\n\r\nMay 25: Andrew Huang\r\n\r\nMay 26: Gabe Cohen\r\n\r\nMay 27: Dillon Scheel\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Student musicians will be performing on the Palo Alto High School Quad during lunch as part of this week's program hosted by the Associated Student Body.","date":"2016-05-24 21:38:53","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/0000\/00\/7_0.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["ASB","emma cole","lunch","Martin Manasherob","music","perform","Peter Willits","quad"]},{"id":120741,"title":"Season recap: Despite hot start, boys&#8217; golf ends in disappointment","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/24\/season-recap-despite-hot-start-boys-golf-ends-in-disappointment\/","content":"<dl id=\"attachment_120830\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1016px;\"><dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\">\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_120842\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_97531.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-120842\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_97531.jpg\" alt=\"Senior captain Henry Gordon tees off in a match early in the season against Los Altos High School.

They completed an undefeated regular season by finishing 14-0 overall heading into the postseason. According to captain junior Timothy Liu, the Vikings cruised into the CCS finals with a lot of confidence, but were unable to execute.\r\n\r\n\"We played very well at Leagues and CCS Regionals, which led up to last week's CCS championship,\" Liu said. \"Unfortunately, we didn't play as well as we would have hoped during the CCS championships and we were eliminated from the competition sooner than we would have liked.\"\r\n\r\nLiu attributes the Vikings' success to senior leadership and a consistent group of underclassmen.\r\n\r\n\"I'm still incredibly proud of how well we played as a team this year,\" Liu said. \"The seniors really held their ground and anchored the team and a talented group of sophomores kept the team's engine churning all year long.\"\r\n\r\nTeam captain, senior Henry Gordon, who has committed to playing golf at Occidental College, agreed with Liu, saying that he excited about where the team currently stands.\r\n\r\n\"It feels good to cap off four years confidently knowing that we are one of the top public teams in the state,\" Gordon said.\r\n\r\nHead coach Doyle Knight will look to build off of this season's strong performance. The Vikings will be led next year by Ali, Liu and sophomore Sergi Mata, among others.\r\n\r\n\"Next year, we're looking to keep up the overall positive season we had this year and hopefully turn the tide during CCS and win it all,\" Liu said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' golf team officially concluded its season on Monday when sophomore Ahmed Ali missed the cut for the state competition by one stroke at the NorCal Golf Championships in Salinas.","date":"2016-05-24 14:28:52","author":"Josh Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/13184547_1720898391485755_1901.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["#norcal","ahmed ali","boys' golf","CCS","doyle knight","henry gordon","matthew lewis","season recap","timothy liu"]},{"id":120508,"title":"Buy a seat in the Performing Arts Center","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/24\/buy-a-seat-in-the-performing-arts-center\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_120511\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"587\"]<img class=\"wp-image-120511\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/PAC.jpg\" alt=\"PAC\" width=\"587\" height=\"393\" \/> The Palo Alto High School Performing Arts Boosters are currently selling seat nameplates in the new Performing Arts Center to raise funds to purchase additional amenities that were not included in the building costs.

We are also soliciting direct donations and donations in any amount are greatly appreciated. We plan to install a donor recognition wall in the lobby of the theater [which will include names of donors who contributed over $100].\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the large effort required to fundraise, Ward is\u00a0excited for the future of the PAC.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was Theater Boosters president from 2007 to 2011 and my daughters both loved theater,\u201d Ward said. \u201cWhen I learned that a group of parents had raised funds for the Media Arts Center, I felt compelled to help raise funds for the PAC and I want to see it through to the end and make sure that it will provide a first class setting for the outstanding performing artists at Paly.

He worked for the Environmental Protection Agency and as a wildlife biologist prior to teaching. Photo by Dhara Yu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jack Kearns points out an oak tree located on the edge of Palo Alto High School's campus Quad. \u201cIt reminds me of a baobab,\u201d he says, referring to the bizarre-looking tree that graces the savannas of Africa, and spouts off a few facts about that plant. To most onlookers the tree is unremarkable,\u00a0but to Kearns, Palo Alto High School's new Advanced Placement Environmental Science teacher, it's evocative of\u00a0the Serengeti and worthy of more than a cursory glance.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing well over six feet tall, with the burly frame of an ex-football player, Kearns is\u00a0genial and outgoing \u2014 he\u2019s the type to give a vigorous wave to passing students and staff, or start up a game of volleyball on the Quad\u00a0after school. It\u2019s not hard to see why the administration thought him a suitable replacement for Kenyon Scott, the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/22\/trust-and-respect-remembering-kenyon-scott\/\" target=\"_blank\">beloved Paly AP Environmental Science teacher<\/a> who suddenly passed away in January.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to go forward with Kenyon\u2019s mantle, to follow in his shadow, to carry on what he had started,\u201d Kearns\u00a0said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kearns\u2019 path to Paly was certainly a serendipitous one. He was working toward his teaching certification when one of his professors in teaching school informed him that there was an opening at Palo Alto High School in environmental science, which would be his first full-time teaching job \u2014 he soon connected with Paly administration and interviewed for the position. But to Kearns, the logistical details are irrelevant.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat matters is that this came together at the right moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided to become a teacher because I felt a calling, from a higher power, and I finally had the opportunity to follow that voice.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kearns keeps a folded envelope in his pocket, scrawled with the quote, \u201cMay God give you entrance to the hearts of those you teach, and then make you know that as you enter there, you stand in holy places.\u201d His teaching philosophy, he says, is to imbue his students with a sense of respect and reverence for the natural world by keeping his class lighthearted and enjoyable, and relating environmental science to their daily lives. As the final assignment for his class, students created chalk drawings with slogans underscoring the importance of preserving the natural world.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"He's very interested in active learning, and having his kids get out and experience the environment,\" said science department instructional supervisor Kelli Hagen about Kearns.\u00a0\"Whether it's on-campus field trips, which he's done a lot of, or off-campus, he wants his students to be engaged.\"\r\n\r\nJunior Mason Wittman, one of Kearns' students, echoes this sentiment, underscoring Kearns' commitment to instilling an admiration for the outdoors\u00a0in his students.\u00a0\"It's not just in the classroom,\" Wittman said. \"We get to go out, and I've really developed a passion for environmental science. I might even pursue it.\"\r\n\r\nBut Kearns himself has realized that his style of education may\u00a0be at odds with certain\u00a0perceptions\u00a0of the community\u2019s tradition of academic rigor. \u201cI sense an academic intensity here,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge to reconcile that.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kearns brings with him an extensive background in ecology \u2014 he\u2019s worked as a wildlife biologist and for the Environmental Protection Agency. His career has\u00a0taken him across the world, to\u00a0the Mojave Desert, the Alaskan glaciers, East Africa and Japan. The plains of Kenya and Tanzania, in particular, hold a special place in his heart.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe landscape was my favorite part,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSitting in the Serengeti \u2014 which means endless plains, it just extends forever, as far as the eye can see \u2014 and watching a lightning and thunder storm. Images like that were my favorite \u2014 just taking everything in and being in awe.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His specialties as a wildlife biologist, Kearns says, are the small carnivores of Africa and birds of prey.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf anyone has a question about mongooses or raptors, they can ask me,\u201d he said\u00a0with a laugh.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Kearns, as he describes it, lives and breathes environmental science, he also has an avid interest in sports.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI played football, basketball, rugby, volleyball, beach volleyball, martial arts, swimming, you name it,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s actually how I got to college, on a football scholarship. I\u2019ve coached on and off for the last ten years.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kearns is very much a family man: he is married, with a 15-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old son. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSpending time with them is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mucho, mucho divertido<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d he said, invoking a bit of Spanish. When asked\u00a0about his foreign language ability, he said he knows a few words of Swahili, Tongan \u2014 he played on a Tongan rugby team \u2014 and Japanese.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He keeps mementos from his cultural experiences, and on his first day of teaching at Paly he brought in two: a warrior's club and a lion's tooth,\u00a0given to him by a\u00a0nomadic Maasai tribe in the Serengeti.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"To become a Masaai warrior, you have to kill a lion,\" Kearns said. \"It's not about animal cruelty. It's about demonstrating that they can protect their family and their tribe.\"\r\n\r\nAs the school year draws to a close, Kearn's future at Paly remains\u00a0uncertain \u2014 his teaching contract with the district goes only through this academic year\u00a0\u2014 but he has clearly earned the respect\u00a0of many his students.\u00a0It's no easy task to stand in as\u00a0a replacement for a teacher, particularly one who was so universally admired, but according to Wittman, Kearns has done so seamlessly, bringing his own experiences into the fold while maintaining the buoyant, optimistic spirit that has characterized this class.\r\n\r\n\"I think Paly did a great job,\" Wittman said. \"They probably found the best possible replacement. We all loved Mr. Scott, but I think everyone loves Mr. Kearns too.\"\r\n\r\nAnd without a doubt, that appreciation is reciprocated, says Kearns.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cI am living the dream. This is my dream job.\"<\/span>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice profiled AP Environmental Science teacher Jack Kearns, who spoke about his athletic prowess, expertise in small African carnivores and passion for teaching.","date":"2016-05-24 10:37:31","author":"Dhara Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/kearns.jpg","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":["AP environmental science","apes","ecology","environmental protection agency","Jack Kearns","Kenyon Scott","what is a mongoose","wildlife biology"]},{"id":120766,"title":"Gunn students plan sit-in; teacher salary decision looms","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/23\/gunn-students-plan-sit-in-teacher-salary-decision-looms\/","content":"Students at Gunn High School are planning a sit-in protest at Tuesday night's school board meeting. The meeting will also address the topic of teacher salaries and the possible ratification of a landmark three-year contract that would involve multiple raises.\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"https:\/\/gunnoracle.com\/2016\/05\/20\/ap-tests-invalidated-due-to-irregularities\/\">Gunn Oracle<\/a> The protest stems from problems that occured with the Advanced Placement (AP) test. Proctor errors, including incorrect distance between students, caused the cancellation of test scores for Calculus BC, Biology, Environmental Science, Physics C, Physics 1, Spanish, Psychology, Computer Science A, Chemistry and English Literature.\r\n\r\nThe canceled test scores require students to either retake the test or forego any scores from invalidated exams. Students received this information several weeks after taking their tests, requiring them to review and study once again even as final tests and projects begin to pile up.\r\n\r\nGunn senior Ben Lee is one of the students affected by this.\r\n\r\n\"I have to retake a three-hour AP Lit [English Literature] test and write three essays again,\" Lee said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lee, the sit-in is an attempt to get students a voice in these situations, and to hold the Gunn administration responsible for its errors in proctoring.\r\n\r\n\"I'd say it's to show the school board and general community that students want to be heard and students are visibly affected and care about this issue,\" Lee said. \"A main goal is to get the administration to actually be held accountable and for the school board to take some action regarding the procedures of administering APs and also how the administration functions.\"\r\n\r\nStudents have also put forth a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/the-gunn-administration-the-annulment-of-final-assignments-for-2016-gunn-school-year\">petition<\/a>\u00a0asking for flexibility with final projects and tests. According to Gunn junior Aidan Lilani, most teachers are fairly receptive to accommodating students' needs.\r\n\r\n\"Most teachers have been really chill,\" Lilani said. \"They've been making finals optional or just lowering the work load.\"\r\n\r\nThe AP mess only serves to reignite tensions between the Gunn students and administration. According to Lilani, the tension comes from the Gunn administration making significant changes to the Gunn system without student input.\r\n\r\n\"I would say there has been tension since they have been making a bunch of changes last year,\" Lilani said. \"First would have been the schedule change, and then getting rid of zero period.\"\r\n\r\nSchool board member Terry Godfrey says the students have made a major step forward by organizing themselves to protest the problems.\r\n\r\n\"I think the students have shown a lot of maturity by being clear through the petition what their expectations for a solution are,\" Godfrey said. \"This is a really tough situation for the students; the mistake was unfortunate but not deliberate and I imagine it will result in more solid procedures for the proctors going forward.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the school board agenda, Supt. McGee will address the AP retake situation in his superintendent's report.\r\n\r\nTeacher salaries are also a topic of debate at the meeting. The school board will vote for a plan that would enact a 5 percent salary raise retroactively from July 2015, a 4 percent raise for the 2016-17 school year, and a 3 percent raise the following year. The plan also institutes bonuses depending on property tax growth.\r\n\r\nAccording\u00a0to Godfrey, the salary change should not be seen as a \u201cmoney grab by teachers.\u201d Several board members pointed to the importance of attracting high-caliber teachers and the high cost of living in the area as rationale for the salary raise.\r\n\r\nThe school board meeting starts at 6:30 p.m Tuesday at the district office.","excerpt":"Students at Gunn High School are planning a sit-in protest at Tuesday night's school board meeting.
