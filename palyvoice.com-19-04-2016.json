We clean it up right away, so the person responsible doesn't get the attention they want.\"\r\n\r\nAccording\u00a0to Berkson, the\u00a0Palo Alto Police Department\u00a0has been contacted to aid in the investigation.\r\n\r\nIn an email to The Paly Voice, Supt. Max McGee stated that\u00a0he encourages students to stand against bigotry.\r\n\r\n\"Hate speech is a serious matter, and those who defaced our campus will suffer serious consequences,\" McGee said. \"We are immediately removing the graffiti, but more importantly, I trust that our Paly students will not tolerate any expression of racial, ethnic or gender disparagement and will take positive steps to assure that our campus is kind, safe and welcoming for every individual.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_119340\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"254\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13059324_1718987974981188_33468229_n1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-119340\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13059324_1718987974981188_33468229_n1.jpg\" alt=\"13059324_1718987974981188_33468229_n\" width=\"254\" height=\"339\" \/><\/a> The boys' restroom in the 800 building was one of several locations on campus vandalized with a pro-Trump message.

The person who did it clearly doesn't understand the hate that they're projecting and what damage they can do.\"\r\n\r\nThe graffiti appeared just as\u00a0Paly began its <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/17\/change-in-our-schools-week-cultivating-a-positive-community\/\">first annual Change In Our Schools Week<\/a>, intended\u00a0to celebrate student diversity and promote respect. Junior Cezanne Lane, an organizer of CIOS Week and Associated Student Body spirit commissioner,\u00a0was also\u00a0taken aback by the hateful comments.\r\n\r\n\"This is really shocking for a community that I thought was so progressive,\" Lane said. \"Hopefully the person who did it didn't mean it, but those words are harmful.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Dami Bolarinwa said he is disappointed by the graffiti. According to Bolarinwa, the Black Lives Matter movement carries an important message that people need to hear.\r\n\r\n\"That's truly heartbreaking to see that people have reverted to such disgrace of integrity,\" Bolarinwa said. \"Black lives and many minority lives are targeted, so it saddens me to know students at Paly feel that way and are continuing to target students on campus with vandalism as this.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Sergio Valente said he believes the messages do not represent the values of the Paly student body.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I saw the graffiti I assumed that the people who created it were just doing so as a joke and thought it was funny,\u201d Valente said. \u201cI think there are many better ways to express juvenile fun and it\u2019s sad that they chose to do so in a way that can be offensive. I also don\u2019t think that it is something that needs to be blown out of proportion as it was the actions of presumably a few individuals and need not reflect on the school as a whole.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Maya Lathi said she thinks that people have the right to express political opinions, but personal beliefs should be shared in ways other than graffiti.\r\n\r\n\"With regards to the 'Black Lives Suck' graffiti, I think it is sad to see that this is a view a fellow student has, but it shouldn't be considered representative of our tolerant student body,\" Lathi said.\u00a0\"In regards to the 'Trump 1237' graffiti, while I disagree with the politics of Donald Trump, I respect each citizen's right to believe in whatever politics they'd like to.\u00a0There are more respectful, less destructive, ways to express one's opinion than vandalism.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Reuben Kramer said he hopes people learn to value respect\u00a0and tolerance.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I think that it's embarrassing that someone would do a hate crime, especially on campus,\" Kramer said. \"I would encourage people to stand up to racism whenever they see it, because it has no place in this world.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nTrump\u00a0is scheduled to appear at the California Republican Party convention on Friday, April 29, in Burlingame.

Each panel is designed to convey a different aspect of Paly, including \u201cWe are creative,\u201d \u201cWe have spirit,\u201d \u201cWe struggle\u201d and \u201cWe learn.\u201d\r\n\r\nArtists working on the mural hope that it will allow students to reflect on their own lives at Paly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe [the students] wanted to create a mural that embodies the entire spirit of Paly,\u201d says junior Grace Zhao, who d<span class=\"_5yl5\">esigned the Spirit Week scene in the bottom left corner<\/span>. \u201cThe mural does not just depict the happy aspects of Paly, but everything about it. We wanted to have an accurate depiction of the student life at Paly.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKenzie echoes these sentiments, stating that this mural's primary purpose is to bring something different to the community.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have had a really tough last couple of years, emotionally, and people from outside have wanted to come on campus to do art,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cIt felt like it was a really good time now to have students do art. It is like there is this call throughout the campus for art that was healing and uplifting and reflective of our lives.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to McKenzie, the current plan is to have at least half the mural completed by the end of this school year.\r\n\r\nZhao says that the artists are in no rush to complete the mural, as the painting is still a learning process. Painters will work in groups that rotate on different days, thereby allowing participants to work on the mural and still cover class material.\r\n\r\nMcKenzie hopes that this mural will spark a conversation about art on campus.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe reason why we are doing this is because the James Franco mural made people talk about art on campus,\" McKenzie said. \"One of the things that the art department is trying to do is to get more artistic experiences, whether it\u2019s art or music out on campus.\"\r\n\r\nAdministrators also want this mural to exhibit the works of Paly's art community.\r\n\r\n\"I think that the mural will display the talented artists that go to school here,\" Assistant Principal of Operations Jerry Berkson said. \"We really just want to show off our talented artists.\"\r\n\r\nArtists are excited to be working on the mural, as they believe they are adding their piece to the Paly legacy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that being able to paint the mural is really cool because it is a student-designed and created mural,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cI feel like it is something that was worth doing, and worth committing time to, as I am helping my school.\u201d","excerpt":"Students in the Advanced Drawing and Painting class are painting a mural on the wall of the Student Activities Center at Palo Alto High School after a James Franco mural was removed early this year.","date":"2016-04-15 16:04:15","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/IMG_0313.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Advanced Drawing and Painting Class","art","grace zhao","james franco","jerry berkson","Kate McKenzie","mural","Student Activities Center"]},{"id":119019,"title":"Liveblog: Baseball faces off against Los Gatos","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/15\/liveblog-baseball-faces-off-against-los-gatos\/","content":"Check back in at 4p.m. as the Palo Alto High School baseball team (13-2-1, 8-1) looks to maintain their first place position against the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (11-8, 7-1) at 4 p.m. Friday at home.
