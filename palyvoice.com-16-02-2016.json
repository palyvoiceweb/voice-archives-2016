In response to the formal reading of his charging documents, Airo\u00a0is expected to enter a plea.\r\n\r\nSupt. Max McGee says the district is expecting to hire an outside firm to conduct an investigation into the case, alleged to have occurred at his former girlfriend's residence 10 years before he became a teacher.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116086\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"327\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_3321.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-116086\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_3321.jpg\" alt=\"Ohlone\" width=\"327\" height=\"245\" \/><\/a> As of Jan. 14, Ohlone Elementary School is no longer the workplace of former teacher Michael Christopher Airo after child sexual abuse charges were brought to light and the district placed him on unpaid compulsory leave.

Ohlone Principal Nicki Smith and McGee sent resources to parents regarding talking to children about delicate situations. McGee said he is open to looking into policies that adapt the district's current hiring practices to avoid similar situations.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe treated the situation similarly as the death [of a student] last year,\" McGee said. \"We called a meeting and we brought in outside help for parents, kids and teachers, and we had a plan on how to work with the media.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a letter sent on Jan. 14 to PAUSD families, McGee stated he was \u201csickened and disgusted\u201d after reading the police report detailing the case.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> McGee said his word choice might have differed if he had been given more time to consider his message, especially considering that Airo\u2019s status as a criminal is not yet confirmed.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn retrospect I would have sent out a more measured letter,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI was really angry because I couldn't imagine behavior like that. \u2026 It was really disturbing.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116087\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"280\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_3432.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-116087\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_3432.jpg\" alt=\"Airo File\" width=\"280\" height=\"210\" \/><\/a> The police report detailing Airo's case is available to the public at the Palo Alto Courthouse.

Hornung stated that the investigation began after the victim revealed to her college psychologist that she had been sexually abused over a three-year period 10 years ago by Airo, her mother\u2019s former live-in boyfriend and aide at victim's school.","excerpt":"Ohlone Elementary School teacher Michael Christopher Airo, currently on unpaid compulsory leave, is scheduled to be arraigned at 9 a.m. Tuesday at the Superior Court of the Palo Alto Judicial District, according to court documents.","date":"2016-02-15 21:51:05","author":"Emily Hwang","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_3321.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["arraignment","court","district","judge","lascivious","lewd","McGee","michael","michael champagne","mike","nicki smith","ohlone","palo alto unified","PAUSD","principal","sexual abuse","superintendent","Teacher","trial"]},{"id":115753,"title":"&#8216;Bridge of Spies:&#8217; the Cold War shrouded in moral ambiguity","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/14\/bridge-of-spies-the-cold-war-shrouded-in-moral-ambiguity\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115792\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"569\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/os-bridge-of-spies-trailer-tom-hanks-20150616.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-115792\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/os-bridge-of-spies-trailer-tom-hanks-20150616.jpg\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of the Orlando Sentinel. \" width=\"569\" height=\"379\" \/><\/a> In \"Bridge of Spies\" Tom Hanks portrays James Donovan, an affluent American lawyer who has been asked to defend a Soviet\u00a0spy.

Photo courtesy of the Orlando Sentinel.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDespite the brilliance that is \u201cBridge of Spies,\u201d its reception by the public has been underwhelming.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is due to the contrast of director Steven Spielberg\u2019s other explosive action films with the slow suspense of his latest work \u201cBridge of Spies,\u201d but nevertheless the film reveals itself magically. The story, based on true events, takes place at the height of the Cold War as both the United States and the Soviet Union\u00a0grapple with fear and suspicion. The plot centers on a Brooklyn-based artist, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who is found to be a Russian spy. This threatening discovery affirms America\u2019s worst fears and causes an outbreak of panic and hatred.\r\n\r\nAlthough Abel seems destined to \u00a0hang, the government attempts to display the superiority of democracy by ensuring him a fair trial. They assign him a successful insurance lawyer, James Donovan (Tom Hanks). Hanks\u00a0plays his typical character masterfully\u2014he\u2019s charismatic, approachable, but not afraid to shake things up. Due to his respect for the fundamentals of due process, Donovan agrees to the case. To his surprise he develops a personal connection with Abel. Hanks and Rylance\u2019s on-screen chemistry is part of what makes the movie so captivating.\r\n\r\nAs Abel's unfortunate fate looms closer, across the country an American spy plane disguised as a weather plane is shot down over the Soviet Union. Suddenly Abel has a hope for a prisoner exchange.\r\n\r\nThe film is long, in typical Spielberg manner, and the beginning is at times\u00a0uneventful, trading action for obvious symbolism and intricate camerawork. Yet the second half, when Donovan is sent to a post-war Berlin, turns out to be the most enthralling, insightful part of the film. Donovan is asked by the U.S. government to work as a third party to arrange the swap. He must travel through both devastated East and West Berlin, as beautiful cinematography captures the stark differences in the two sides both visibly and economically even just after the wall has come up; The West is filled with tantalizing stores and light, and the east dark and hazy with young gangs on every corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cBridge of Spies\u201d received six Oscar nominations this year for \u201cBest Picture,\u201d \u201cBest Original Score,\u201d \u201cBest Production Design,\u201d \u201cBest Sound Mixing,\u201d\u201cBest Original Screenplay,\u201d as well as \u201cBest Actor in a Supporting Role,\u201d for Rylance\u2019s performance as Abel.\r\n\r\nRylance delivers an exceptional yet nuanced performance, often overshadowed by more dramatic dialogue. While his performance\u00a0is notable, its\u00a0subtlety will most likely take away Rylance\u2019s prospect of winning \u201cBest Actor in a Supporting Role,\u201d especially considering the other strong candidates.\r\n\r\nBoth Hanks and Rylance give stellar performances, yet the real treasure of \u201cBridge of Spies\u201d is the portrayal of ethical uncertainty Donovan must face. While American society and media easily paint Abel as a communist villain, Donovan can see he\u2019s truly just a patriot, doing what he must for his country.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Bridge of Spies\"<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2 hours 21 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated PG-13 for some violence and profanity<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by Steven Spielberg<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Starring Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Alan Alda, Amy Ryan, and Billy Magnussen<\/strong>","excerpt":"In \"Bridge of Spies,\" Tom Hanks portrays James Donovan, an affluent American lawyer who has been asked to defend a Soviet spy.

Performances ranged from solos to small groups to larger groups and included a San Francisco-themed medley that was performed by the Beginning Choir.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Bay Area needs a little Bay Area love,\u201d Najar said. \u201cWith all sorts of things happening, like the Super Bowl coming to town, it just seemed like the right time to do a Bay Area theme.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Pops Concert, unlike other concerts, is much more casual and allows the students to express themselves through the music that they select\u00a0to perform, according to Najar.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey choose the music,\u201d Najar said. \u201cThey work on it. They rehearse with each other. They work through all the problems that a regular musician would have in putting together a concert.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Taylor Duncan, the Pops Concert allows the students to form a community.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the concert where it\u2019s super laid back and it\u2019s not so choral-heavy,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cWe get to know\u00a0everyone in the choir and in Beginning Choir and in all the different groups a lot more. It\u2019s awesome that we really get to connect in this concert.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe entire choir sported tie-dye shirts, which were hand-made last Friday after school on the Quad in an activity led by junior Spencer Wycoff.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Najar got a bunch of blank shirts with the Paly Pops Concert logos on them, so we tie-dyed them on Friday after school,\u201d Wycoff said. \u201cThe shirts that look extra dope are the ones that I made.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Pops Concert was the last that the Paly choirs will perform in the Haymarket Theater, according to Najar.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do next year,\u201d Najar said. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the Haymarket, but things are going to change so we\u2019re excited about the change.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to senior Sean Jawetz, choir is a great way to create art, and this experience is enriched by the Pops Concert.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the Pops Concert] really turns choir from a class into a community,\u201d Jawetz said. \u201cI will definitely continue to do choir in college because I think that choir is a great art form that allows you to express yourself and do something fun.\u201d","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School choirs performed their annual Pops Concert with a Bay Area music-themed focus on Wednesday in the Haymarket Theater.","date":"2016-02-14 16:06:34","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_5245.jpg","categories":["Entertainment"],"tags":[]},{"id":116100,"title":"County to begin health investigation","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/13\/county-to-begin-health-investigation\/","content":"The Santa Clara County Public Health Department is scheduled to start field work later this month in its Epi-Aid project that will look into suicide data for local school districts, according to Public Health officials who spoke at the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education meeting on Tuesday in the district office.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pam Stoddard, director of research for Public Health at the Santa Clara County Public Health Department, the Epi-Aid for Santa Clara County is aimed to combat suicides and the issues that surround it in the county, because of the strong of suicides among incoming, current and alumni members of PAUSD from 2009-2015.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn \u2018Epi-Aid\u2019, or epidemiological assistance, is an investigation of an urgent public health problem,\u201d Stoddard said to the board. \u201cThe CDC [Center for disease control] has this mechanism in place so that state and local public health officials can request assistance with these urgent problems because they may not have the local capacity or subject matter expertise to fully address them. The goal is to determine the causes and the extent of the problem, so these are really about developing prevention and control recommendations.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe preparation period for the Epi-Aid occurred during December and January, and will now move on to the fieldwork portion of the project, which is scheduled to take place from February 16-29, according to Stoddard. Stoddard says that when this stage is completed, a follow-up stage will take place.\r\n\r\nThe Epi-Aid is aimed at giving the county short term-assistance by providing epidemiology-focused objectives and recommendations, which are based on the incidence, distribution and possible control of health issues, according to Stoddard.\r\n\r\n\u201cFocusing on the county\u00a0will\u00a0provide us some flexibility in comparing cities and school districts within the county to see if we can understand more about patterns and trends,\u201d Stoddard said. \"The main goal is to make some recommendations on prevention strategies that can be used in the school district, the city and the county.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe investigation will also include a review of media coverage, prevention activities and protocols used by communities and school districts, comparing them to national recommendations around suicide prevention, according to Stoddard.\r\n\r\nThe Epi-Aid staff will not be allowed to conduct any new research but can take data from the county coroner\u2019s office, death certificates, hospital data, school surveys and 911 calls, according to Stoddard. Additionally, the CDC will be able to design objectives, provide technical assistance, complete a wide-range media scan to ensure safe reporting, meet with local agencies, analyze data, draft reports and provide feedback and recommendations for the county and city, according to Stoddard.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is an epidemiological approach, so it doesn\u2019t use methods like psychological autopsies, so they won\u2019t be able to investigate individual deaths,\u201d Stoddard said.","excerpt":"The Santa Clara County Public Health Department is scheduled to start field work in its Epi-Aid project for local school districts, according to Public Health Department officials at the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education meeting on Tuesday at the district office.","date":"2016-02-13 17:30:17","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMAG0439.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["cdc","center for disease control and prevention","district office","epi-aid","Palo Alto Unified School District","palo alto unified school district board of education","public health department","School Board"]},{"id":116278,"title":"Students showcase work in Arts in Unusual Places","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/13\/students-showcase-work-in-arts-in-unusual-places\/","content":"<hr \/>\r\n\r\nVisual and performing arts students showcased their talents in demonstrations during the annual Art in Unusual Places celebration at Palo Alto High School.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/social.shorthand.com\/thepalyvoice\/embed\/jgcstJdSbf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"Visual and performing arts students showcased their talents in demonstrations during the annual Art in Unusual Places celebration at Palo Alto High School.\r\n","date":"2016-02-13 00:27:45","author":"Emilia Diaz-Magaloni","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/12735685_1668667386726622_1927706921_n-12.jpg","categories":["Multimedia"],"tags":["Andy Goldsworthy","art","art in unusual places","Claudio Malagrino","Elizabeth Wilkinson","josh code","Kaitlyn Nakamura","Keith Haring","najar","steve ferrera"]},{"id":116173,"title":"Admin removes James Franco mural from Student Center","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/11\/admin-removes-james-franco-mural-from-student-center\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_116177\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"592\"]<img class=\"wp-image-116177\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/james-franco-mural1.jpg\" alt=\"james franco mural\" width=\"592\" height=\"395\" \/> One of James Franco's murals on the Student Center was painted over yesterday evening. \"Our art department is working with some students on other murals to put up around campus,\" Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio said.

Larson is nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her captivating\u00a0performance as a woman kidnapped for seven years. Photo: A24 films.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to imagine living in just one room for seven years. It\u2019s even harder to imagine turning the survival story of the woman held captive and the coming-of-age story of her son into a successful, uplifting movie. Instead of portraying a tragedy as yet another emotionally draining drama, \u201cRoom\u201d manages to find hope in the horrifying, resulting in a powerful film that carries the weight necessary to contend with the other great works in its Oscars nomination category.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cRoom,\u201d based on the New York Times bestselling book of the same title by Emma Donoghue, tells the story of 17-year-old Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) who is kidnapped and held in a shack for seven years by her kidnapper Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). In that time, she gives birth to a boy named Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and raises him to the best of her ability, teaching him that their garden shed, Room, is all there is to the world. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the highlights and unique features of the movie is the fact that it is narrated by 5-year-old Jack. His innocent perspective not only provides optimism in a bleak situation, but also depth as he explains how Room is his world, and humor as he explains how aliens control heaven and birth. For such a young child actor, the depth of emotion accurately portrayed is nothing short of amazing. His dialogue is\u00a0also carefully constructed, taking into consideration how Jack bases his whole existence off one room. The outside world is simply \u201cspace\u201d and his disbelief in the existence of things like dogs and trees is communicated through his anger and fear manifesting in a tantrum and the words \u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d In other scenes, however, Jack plays with the childlike abandon shared by all 5-year-olds, resulting in a compelling character able to tie innocence and joy to what is by all accounts a nightmare.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Lenny Abrahamson, also nominated for an Oscar, utilizes camera angles and lighting to full effect. When Jack sees outside the room for the first time, the glaring light hitting the camera matches what his sensitive eyes would see. When he\u2019s crouched on the floor the camera also lowers, and when he\u2019s in argument with his mother the close-up facial shots convey the smallest changes in emotion. One issue with Abrahamson\u2019s use of the camera is that at certain times it feels overly realistic. Shaky cameras, when used in moderation, add to the performance, but in excess make the scene overwhelming for the wrong reasons.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all aspects of the movie, a clear effort to strip away the glamour of the traditional Hollywood drama is apparent: ordinarily beautiful Larson appears limp and pallid in soiled costumes, Old Nick is a rationalizing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, unemployed middle-aged man instead of the stereotypically violent aggressor, and Jack is not completely oblivious to the injustice of his situation despite his misunderstanding of the outside world. The movie gains gravitas from choosing to present moments that show this honesty, like shots of Jack listening to his mother\u2019s interactions with Old Nick at night, instead of the more stylized sequences often favored by other dramas.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the beautiful parts of the movie is\u00a0that the director does not\u00a0rely on dramatic music to make his points, and instead lets silence illustrate emotion. In one particular scene, as Joy contemplates the risk of her escape plan, her face, the rhythm of her breathing and her tightly clenched fists say it all.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Larson\u2019s performance is outstanding. Her character radiates the fierce maternal love so crucial to Jack\u2019s protection through the smallest glance or shift in tone. Her role encompasses nearly the entire range of human emotion in one film, and Larson meets each shift with underplayed intensity. From the very first opening shot, the audience is rooting for her, and though nothing like Joy\u2019s sacrifices are\u00a0experienced by Larson, Larson\u2019s character remains stunningly believable throughout the film.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, \u201cRoom\u201d is a film about perspective. As Jack and Ma lean on each other through their extreme escape, they realize the power of love and hope. Their ability to find the humor and excitement in everything, and their experience of looking at the world with fresh eyes is a valuable lesson in enjoying the little moments in life. \u201cRoom\u201d is a powerful, out of the box film about our ability to survive and adapt when all we have is love.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>\u201cRoom\u201d<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>1 hour, 58 minutes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Release Date: 16\u00a0October\u00a02015<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Rated: R\u00a0for language<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Directed by\u00a0Lenny Abrahamson<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Starring:\u00a0Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridgers<\/b>","excerpt":"Instead of turning a tragedy into yet another emotionally draining drama, \u201cRoom\u201d manages to find hope in the horrifying, creating a powerful film that carries the weight necessary to contend with the other great works in its Oscars category.","date":"2016-02-11 18:04:36","author":"Maya McNealis","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Room-2015-Lenny-Abrahamson-01-1024x614.jpg","categories":["A&amp;E Section Spotlight","Entertainment","Oscars 2016"],"tags":["best actress","brie larson","jacob tremblay","oscars","room"]},{"id":116185,"title":"Democrats to face off in debate","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/11\/democrats-to-face-off-in-debate\/","content":"Join The Paly Voice as we liveblog the Democratic debate between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders tonight at 6 p.m. on PBS.\r\n\r\n[liveblog]","excerpt":"Join The Paly Voice as we liveblog the Democratic debate between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders tonight at 6 p.m.","date":"2016-02-11 17:39:13","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/demdebate.jpg","categories":["News","Uncategorized"],"tags":["Bernie","Bernie Sanders","Clinton","Deabte","democrats","Hillary","Hillary Clinton","liveblog","Presidential race","Sanders"]},{"id":116058,"title":"Wrestling to attend SCVAL tournament this weekend","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/11\/wrestling-to-attend-scval-tournament-this-weekend\/","content":"<div class=\"gmail_default\">\n[caption width=\"614\" id=\"attachment_116136\" align=\"aligncenter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.57.57-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-116136\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.57.57-PM.png\" alt=\"Freshman Callum Day-Ham knocks down his opponent at the dual meet against Gunn on Thursday.
