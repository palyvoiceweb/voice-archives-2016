We\u2019re seeing a trend across the nation of parents and students exercising that right.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to California Education Code \u00a760615, parents are allowed to let their children opt out of California standardized tests, such as the Smarter Balanced test, if the school's main office receives a handwritten note of excuse from parents.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Smarter Balanced Test is to measure the strength of a school\u2019s curriculum, according Diorio. In a recent email sent to juniors and their parents, Diorio encouraged students to take the test.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile the results of the test will not be included on your transcript and will not be used in the college admission process, the results will be used to assess the quality of our school and its programs,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nThere are several ramifications of a low participation rate, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn order to maintain our excellent rankings and strong reputation, both locally and nationally, it\u2019s important that we reach a 95 percent participation rate,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nIn addition to impacting the school\u2019s reputation, the tests can also help students, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe results from the Smarter Balance tests may be used to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Gold State Seal Merit Diploma, State Seal of Biliteracy and California State University's Early Assessment Program,\" Diorio said.\r\n\r\nJunior Michelle Leong is opting out of the test because she feels that it\u00a0would be a waste of time.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not want to take the Smarter Balanced test because I don\u2019t want to be at school for two days taking a test that seems irrelevant and not worth my time,\u201d Leong said.\r\n\r\nSenior Joseph Kao, who took the test last year, opted out after the first section of the exam.\r\n\r\n\"There was a section where they gave us two hours to finish a total of five questions, so it was kind of a waste of time,\u201d Kao said. \u201cIt was also a stressful period during junior year and I had a lot of work to do so I just decided to opt out. I knew a lot of people who were against the Common Core as well so that gave a different perspective on the whole testing situation.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, some students are still taking the test because it is a low-stakes assessment for them.\r\n\r\n\"I feel bad for opting out of a test that could provide valuable information for future students, especially since I have a younger sibling,\" junior Alan Huang said. \"It's actually not that much time compared to how much time I waste usually and I don't have much homework due after AP [Advanced Placement]\u00a0testing anyways.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Administration aims to increase student attendance for the state-standardized Smarter Balanced test that juniors will take on Tuesday and Wednesday at Paly.\r\n\r\n","date":"2016-05-16 18:45:20","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Screen-Shot-2015-04-27-at-4.26.04-PM.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["admin","diorio","improve","palo alto high","paly","participation rate","smarter balance test"]},{"id":120434,"title":"Paly Voices: Marie Davis","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/16\/paly-voices-marie-davis\/","content":"This is the first installment of the series \"Paly Voices,\" which showcases art by Palo Alto High School students.

Akioka said the team stayed strong despite trailing for most of the game.\r\n\r\n\"Our team did a great job of battling from behind and getting the hits when it mattered,\" Akioka said.\r\n\r\nDown 2-0, the Vikings were unable to score off Los Gatos' starting ace until the seventh and final inning where they sparked a three run rally.\r\n\r\nThis unlikely comeback started with a walk of senior Justin Hull, followed by a deep double off the right field wall by sophomore second baseman Max Jung-Goldberg. A pair of singles by seniors Alec Olmstead and Lawrence Han scored both Hull and Jung-Goldberg.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings finally took the lead off of a beautiful bunt by junior pinch-hitter Michael Champagne, which scored Olmstead from third.\r\n\r\nChampagne said the Vikings defense, specifically their pitching, enabled the offense to make a comeback late in the game and hopes the team can carry its momentum into the Central Coast Section playoffs.  \r\n\r\n\"Our pitching helped keep us in the game and we finally came alive in the 7th and had a great rally to take the lead,\" Champagne said. \"Niko Lillios provided a clutch closing inning to seal the victory.

She teaches English 9 and English 9A, as well as Humanities. While Park loves teaching high school English, teaching was not her first passion.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI graduated from law school, but when I left law school I decided I really didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer,\u201d Park said. \u201cI really loved English, which was my major, but when I spoke with my professors a few years later and said 'I\u2019m thinking about becoming a professor,' they were like \u2018Don\u2019t do it! If you want to teach, go to public school, because there are no jobs in the humanities Ph.D. market.\u2019\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Park took her professor\u2019s advice and started looking at programs that would give her a teaching credential. She decided she wanted to move to California\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and ended up going to Stanford University's teacher education program.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen I started looking for jobs there was an opening here at Paly. It was part time and I was like, 'I can't do that because I have to pay rent,'\" Park said. \"Incredibly fortuitously, a teacher soon after took a leave for a year and there were enough classes open that I could get nearly a full-time position. I was hired at Paly and have been here for the past four years.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Park explains that one of the major differences between being a lawyer and teaching high schoolers is who you are working for.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was thinking of doing corporate law and my clients would have been gigantic corporations,\" Park said. \"I was so used to thinking about adults as my clients, and as a teacher, I had to readjust my thinking and start being more aware of the different issues surrounding public education, from the legal issues to policy to even the social-emotional aspects of the students.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the difficult transition from lawyer to high school teacher, Park says that being open to changing careers taught her how to relate to Paly students.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI would say my biggest piece of advice is don't pigeonhole yourself; be open to changing your path or looking for new opportunities, and don\u2019t be afraid to embrace them because it is really easy to get into the mindset of 'this is what I'm going to do and this is what I'm going to be,'\u201d Park said.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nPark recalls having spent all of her\u00a0high school and college\u00a0years preparing for pre-law. However, when she achieved her goal, she realized that being a lawyer just wasn't for her.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI planned to be a lawyer since 8th grade\u00a0when people told me I talk too much and therefore I should be a lawyer,\" Park said. \"It was the scariest and biggest decision I've probably made in my life so far, to give up three years of education and a lot of money and not have a plan,\" Park said. \"I had a year where I had to think about what I wanted to do. It's terrifying, but I think that being really open to that is a super important thing.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Park switching to teaching was the best decision she's ever made.\r\n\r\n\"I love teaching, and I\u2019m fortunate to be in a career when I\u2019m actually excited about coming to work and happy about the work I do, versus dreading the day ahead,\" Park said.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with English and Humanities teacher Mimi Park over an iced latte to discuss her transition from prospective lawyer to teacher, and her advice for Paly students.","date":"2016-05-12 21:08:12","author":"Daniella Maydan","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13081997_1018696691539752_124260599_n.jpg","categories":["Coffee chats","Features"],"tags":["coffeechats","english","Humanities","mimi park","palo alto","paly"]},{"id":120425,"title":"Liveblog: Baseball vs. Los Gatos in SCVAL elimination game","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/12\/liveblog-baseball-vs-los-gatos-in-scval-elimination-game\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_120116\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/baseball-beats-los-altos.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/baseball-beats-los-altos.jpg\" alt=\"Senior pitcher Alec Olmstead warms up with Senior catcher Lawrence Han before a regular season game against Los Gatos High School.
