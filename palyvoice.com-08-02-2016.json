They danced alongside big-time musicians Coldplay, Bruno Mars and Beyonc\u00e9, spinning colorful flower umbrellas and precisely rotating formations with around 200 other dancers.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Higashi, the only performer from the cheer team, a favorite part of the experience was spending a few days before the game with the performers. Guan agreed that working alongside\u00a0the famous artists was a memorable moment. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe highlight of the performance was definitely when Jay-Z and Blue Ivy walked past me and waved,\u201d Guan said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Paly cheer and dance team became involved about a month ago when Julie Zimmer, the halftime show casting director, contacted the team to perform, according to Guan.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Super Bowl halftime coordinators contacted our coach via email,\u201d Sternfield said. \u201cWe submitted a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AjCgcVY8fJw\" target=\"_blank\">video<\/a> of our team performing multiple dances, and soon after they contacted us saying we've been chosen to dance in the halftime show.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After being chosen, the performers committed to confidentiality and hours of practice.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed to tell anyone for around a month, but we had to leave school early a couple days to practice around five to six hours in Santa Clara,\u201d Castillo said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Wednesday through Friday leading up to the Super Bowl, the Paly performers had extra rehearsals from 3 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., according to Jozefov.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThose rehearsals were really fun because most of the time we were watching the singers perform,\u201d Jozefov said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dancers agreed that overall, their inclusion in the performance was an unforgettable opportunity.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was definitely an experience of a lifetime and being a part of this event was one that I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d Castillo said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nSee posted recording by \"Heavy\"\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/heavy.com\/sports\/2016\/02\/super-bowl-50-halftime-show-2016-performances-watch-video\/\" target=\"_blank\">here.<\/a>","excerpt":"Eight members of Palo Alto High School's cheer and dance team performed at the Super Bowl 50 halftime show today.","date":"2016-02-07 17:07:57","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/12687887_1124695217549030_2321994312789312104_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["beyonce","bruno mars","carolina panthers","cheer","chris martin","coldplay","dance","denver broncos","football","halftime show","super bowl 50"]},{"id":115869,"title":"Girls&#8217; soccer falls to Mountain View, ending hopes for perfect season","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/07\/girls-soccer-falls-to-mountain-view-ending-hopes-for-perfect-season\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115871\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"599\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/jacey.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-115871\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/jacey.jpg\" alt=\"Senior Jacey Pederson (19) weaves through the Mountain View defense.

According to Paly head coach Kurt Devlin, Lu will likely recover soon but Pederson's prognosis is uncertain.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Right off of the starting whistle, Mountain View and its forward duo, junior Natasha Harris and senior Ysa<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_115872\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"323\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/ansley.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-115872\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/ansley.jpg\" alt=\"Senior Ansley Queen goes up for a header against Mountain View's Bethan Parry.

But the Spartans broke through in the 10th minute, when Harris received a through ball at the top of the 18-yard box, drew Paly goalkeeper Linnea Carlstrom out of position and evaded two defenders, finding\u00a0the back of the net for Mountain View's first goal.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the first half stoppage time, Harris\u00a0sent a dangerous chip into the box that resulted in a defensive miscommunication by the Vikings. In the chaos, Mountain View's\u00a0Maddie Neidig tapped the ball through to double the Spartans'\u00a0lead.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Paly's prolific offense, which has produced 51 goals this season, found itself stifled by the Mountain View defense.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">The second half looked like it would be better for the Vikings after they made tactical adjustments, including moving Lu to forward, and created\u00a0several promising chances. But things quickly deteriorated when Pederson limped off the field 10 minutes into the half with a hamstring injury, and Lu came off a few minutes later with a leg cramp.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Left without two of its biggest playmakers, Paly fizzled toward the end of the half, unable to produce chances as Mountain View continued to apply pressure on the offensive end.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe started out the second half pretty well,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cAfter the injuries, it was pretty much an uphill battle. But you have to give them [Mountain View] a little bit of credit, because they had a good game plan, and they executed pretty well.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mountain View's Harris emphasized that her team's\u00a0offensive success was due to tactical improvements.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe past couple of games, we hadn\u2019t been able to score much,\u201d Harris said. \u201cToday, we played to our forwards\u2019 strengths by playing to their feet.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Paly junior defender Talia Malchin said that the athleticism of Mountain View\u2019s attackers was the greatest contributing factor to the game\u2019s result.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was more a matter of the individual speed and skill of the forwards, rather than the whole team,\u201d Malchin\u00a0said. \u201cThey created the most issues for us as defenders.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the offensive front, sophomore midfielder Emily Tomz expressed disappointment\u00a0with the Vikings\u2019 inability to convert chances.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe should have been able to slot some in, with the amount of time we had possession of the ball in the final third of the field,\u201d Tomz\u00a0said.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tomz also noted that the Vikings went in with a more defensive mindset, knowing that they only needed to tie Mountain View to maintain their first-place position in league. Despite the setback, she\u00a0emphasized that the team was going to bounce back for the final stretch of league play.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"A\u00a0loss is a loss, and as we talked about after the game, that happened to be an important loss,\u201d Tomz said. \u201cBut we still have four more games to play.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The result\u00a0was particularly frustrating for the Vikings because they were looking to avenge their loss to Mountain View in the the Central Coast Section Division I championship game last year. But Tomz remains optimistic that they will have another opportunity to do so.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHopefully we'll see them\u00a0sometime again soon in CCS,\u201d Tomz\u00a0said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In their next game, the Vikings will take on Santa Clara at 3:30 p.m. on Feb. 10 at Mountain View High School. To have a shot at the De Anza League title, Paly\u00a0needs\u00a0to win out the remainder of its games and have Mountain View lose at least once in league play.<\/p>","excerpt":"Unable to find offensive rhythm, the Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 soccer team (13-1-1, 8-1-1) saw its hopes of an unbeaten season dashed after falling 0-2 to Mountain View (14-0-2, 7-0-2) on Friday.","date":"2016-02-07 11:04:17","author":"Dhara Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/jacey.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap","Spotlight"],"tags":["emily tomz","girls soccer","jacey pederson","kurt devlin","mountain view","paly","talia malchin","vikings"]},{"id":115387,"title":"Season Update: Girls&#8217; soccer looks towards CCS","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/05\/season-update-girls-soccer-looks-towards-ccs\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115550\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"581\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Homestead-vs-PALY.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-115550\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Homestead-vs-PALY.png\" alt=\"Photo by Ethan Kao.\" width=\"581\" height=\"436\" \/><\/a> Junior midfielder Natalie Maloney dribbles the ball past defenders as the Vikings beat the Homestead Mustangs 5-0 on Friday.\u00a0Photo by Ethan Kao.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter\u00a0an impressive season comes to a close, the Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 soccer team (12-0-1, 7-0-1) continues to dominate opponents with stellar offense and fluid defense, maintaining their undefeated record.\r\n\r\nWith a recent 5-0 win against the Homestead Mustangs on\u00a0Friday, and a 6-0 win against the Milpitas Trojans\u00a0on Wednesday, the Vikings have been crushing opponents game after game.\r\n\r\nAssistant coach Eric Seedman reflects on the team's strong performance so far.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first half of the season has been great and I think our record reflects how the girls have been playing,\u201d Seedman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to improve from last season and I think we will only get better.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth the boys and the girls soccer teams have impressed with their dual undefeated streak, winning all 30 games thus far.

We've proved drastically what we can do and we look to improve every practice, every game.\"\r\n\r\nGiven the success of the Vikings, senior defender Alison Lu stresses the importance of not allowing the wins to stifle improvement.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have been playing well but there are definitely things we can work on,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThere are still some communication issues on the field and we need to work on keeping possession. Improving that will really help us out. We also know the rising seniors and juniors are strong and will uphold what we've accomplished this season so far.\u201d\r\n\r\nMidfielder Emily Tomz compares this season to the last, emphasizing how they have improved.\r\n\r\n\"Compared to last season, I definitely think we have a greater chance at winning leagues and CCS,\" Tomz said. \"We are a really strong and talented group, with a firm defense, crafty midfielders, and fast forwards who score often and with precision.

According to Magana, the b<\/span>lood center often experiences a shortage in donations during the winter season because many regular donors are sick with colds or the flu. In addition, recent medical procedures have used up a significant amount of blood, making the blood center's shortage even worse. Magana explains that while the blood center is in dire need of -AB, -B and -O blood donations, all blood types are needed and welcomed.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it takes up to three days after donation to get blood ready for transfusion, it is imperative that people donate their blood soon in order for it to be ready in time for the Super Bowl, according to Magana.<\/span>\r\n\r\nJunior Sophie Pedersen encourages all eligible Paly students to donate their blood.\r\n\r\n\"The reason I want to donate blood is that it just seems like an easy way to help people and I think I have the blood type the donation center is looking for,\" Pedersen said. \"I would encourage anybody who has the time to do it because [the blood center] is experiencing a blood shortage.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Magana, donations take approximately one hour, and students who wish to donate must be at least 16 years old with parental consent or 17 years old or older without parental consent.

Leading the second place team, Homestead, in league by seven points has given the team a high guarantee of winning the league, a clear goal for the team. According to head coach Don Briggs, Paly has not won two consecutive league contests, so a league win to follow last year\u2019s success would be monumental for the team.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn at least the last seven years, we haven\u2019t won two consecutive league contests,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to win league here.

That would be huge.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/high-schools\/palo-alto-vikings-(palo-alto,ca)\/soccer-winter\/home.htm\">maxpreps.com<\/a>, the Vikings are currently ranked 18th in the state and 61st in the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings have had great potential since the beginning of the season, but learning to work cohesively as the season progressed has contributed to their success, according to senior captain and goalkeeper Eli Friedlander.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn some level, I thought that we would be good, but I didn\u2019t know that we would be this good,\u201d Friedlander said. \u201cAt the beginning of the year, we started off a little shaky, but in league we\u2019ve really proved that we can play together pretty well and that we deserve the success we\u2019ve been having.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Briggs, the team needs to work on staying focused during games and communicating on defense, as that has been a significant contributor to getting scored on in recent games.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to tighten up our defense,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had two [recent] games where we\u2019ve made mistakes in the defense. That [two goals from Los Gatos High School and Homestead each] is four goals in the last two games, and we\u2019ve given up six goals in the whole [league] season. That\u2019s an issue. That\u2019s not a trend we want, and a lot of that [comes from] a lack of focus.\u201d\r\n\r\nWinning league this year would favor the Vikings in seeding for the Central Coast Section playoffs, which would allow them to face less difficult competition early on, according to junior captain and center defender Neil Verwillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s great as far as CCS seeding goes, as that would pretty much guarantee us a top three spot and would give us an easier run in CCS,\u201d Verwillow said. \u201cLast year, I know that they had a tough run in CCS as they played Bellarmine [College Preparatory] pretty early on and Bellarmine is tough competition, but I think this year will be better.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly will face off Mountain View High School (7-4-5, 3-3-2) at 3:30 p.m. Friday at Mountain View.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 soccer team (12-0-3, 7-0-2) continues to remain undefeated in its De Anza League season and leads its league division with 21 points, over second place Homestead High School (7-2-7, 3-1-4) with 13 points.","date":"2016-02-04 10:40:38","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_80871.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["Bellarmine","boys soccer","don briggs","eli friedlander","gunn titans","homestead high school","los gatos high school","neil verwillow","palo alto high school","Soccer","sports"]},{"id":115677,"title":"ASB announces joint Gunn-Paly dance details","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/03\/asb-announces-joint-gunn-paly-dance-details\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Palo Alto and Gunn high school student governments\u00a0released more information about the\u00a0combined Gunn-Paly dance on Feb. 26 at the Mitchell Park Community Center in a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/V4bEf3TQLuI\">promotional video<\/a>.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dance\u2019s official theme is \u201cHighlight of the Night,\u201d and students should dress casually in all-white with elements of neon, said organizers, who will also provide body paint to color clothing.\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Paly junior\u00a0Social Commissioner Maryland Valdez-Gonzalez, student officers hope to bolster unity between the schools.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBoth the Paly and Gunn student bodies decided to create and combine a dance ... for the purpose of creating a stronger bond between both high schools in the Palo Alto community,\u201d Valdez-Gonzalez said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly's Associated Student Body and Gunn's Student Executive Council\u00a0first began developing combined dance plans in November and December, according to Gunn Dance Commissioner Radhika Ranganathan.

And<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0while airplane noise can be annoying, Palo Alto should do more than reroute planes if we wish to limit sound pollution.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sky Posse\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skypossepaloalto.org\/\">website<\/a>, airplanes flying over Palo Alto have increased nearly 200% since NextGen's implementation. To better understand the effects of these changes on the community, I spoke with Phil Martien, air quality engineering manager from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. According to Martien,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">these flights do not have a large environmental impact on the Bay Area.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial aircrafts do contribute to the Bay Area's inventory of air pollution emissions for compounds that have direct health impacts, but compared to the region's total, they are not a major source,\u201d Martien said. \u201cBecause the jet flights are above the immediate layer of air where people live and breathe, the direct impact of these flights and changes to flight paths won't have a big impact on air quality.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nIn addition, Martien says that the Bay Area\u2019s air quality is good compared to other urban American cities, and is improving.\r\n\r\nOur\u00a0air may not appear to be greatly affected by NextGen's redirected flights, but the City of Palo Alto should study the long-term effects of airborne transportation on the environment.\r\n\r\n\"I would say that even if the impact on air quality is not a 'big impact' ...\u00a0it is still an impact\u00a0\u00a0and I would like our air quality analyzed in the most up to date way possible,\" Sky Posse co-leader Rachel Kellerman said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_114501\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"403\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/air-traffic-control-baytracon-sfo.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-114501\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/air-traffic-control-baytracon-sfo.jpg\" alt=\"air-traffic-control-baytracon-sfo\" width=\"403\" height=\"307\" \/><\/a> Increased air traffic above the Bay Area has led to numerous noise complaints since early 2014. Sky Posse co-leader Jennifer Landesmann says she hopes to work with the FAA to redesign Bay Area airplane routes. \"We need the FAA ... to give us some immediate relief,\" Landessman said. Photo\u00a0courtesy of\u00a0SFO Noise Abatement Office.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite little cause for alarm with regards to air quality, Sky Posse is correct that\u00a0resulting sound pollution is an issue.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey [new flight routes] could have significant impacts on noise levels,\" Martien said. \"And noise itself can have health impacts.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The airplane noise itself is not generally bothersome compared to other forms of transportation in Palo Alto. After all, over 25 trains pass parallel to Palo Alto High School each day, and its cacophonous horns are far more likely to disturb my daily life than a plane thousands of feet in the air. In addition, Palo Alto\u2019s population nearly <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2010\/02\/02\/palo-alto-neighborhoods\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">triples <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">each day due to commuters entering and leaving for work. The resulting traffic, from buses to honking cars, largely outweighs any noise pollution from planes.<\/span>\r\n\r\nHowever, some residents claim the planes\u2019 noise has negatively impacted their overall well-being.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don\u2019t mind complaining. I just mind the planes and the noise,\u201d one woman at a Sky Posse meeting said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nLow-flying planes may be irritating to some Palo Altans, but this newfound noise is only the tip of the iceberg.\u00a0If we\u00a0wish to limit noise pollution, we should not restrict ourselves to focusing solely on that of airplanes. Traffic congestion and trains\u2019 blaring horns are issues that are just as important to address. If we want a happier and quieter community, collaborating with both the FAA and local city councils is a vital step on limiting all unneeded noise, regardless of the source.","excerpt":"New flight routes above Palo Alto have limited environmental effects and only represent the tip of the iceberg of Bay Area noise pollution.","date":"2016-02-03 16:07:17","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/air-traffic-control-baytracon-sfo.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["airplane noise","annoying","association","aviation","Bay Area","environment","faa","federal","martien","nextgen","noise","palo alto","paly","peninsula","phil","plane","pollution","sky posse","transportation"]}]
