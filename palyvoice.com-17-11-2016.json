According to Alonso, a bilingual education helps immigrant students learn English while also preserving the culture of their own languages. \"The goal is that over four years students will still learn about the culture of their own language while becoming proficient in English,\" Alonso said.

While students do have more educational options, the proposition -now law-\u00a0still requires that all students become proficient in English.\r\n\r\nProp. 58\u00a0passed with a \u00a0remarkable approval rating of\u00a0approximately 73 percent.\r\n\r\nAccording to Spanish teacher and former instructional supervisor of the Palo Alto High School World\u00a0Languages department Kevin Duffy, English-only programs are detrimental to a young student's native language.\r\n\r\n\"According to many studies,\u00a0a single language program will cause students to ignore their native language,\" Duffy said.\u00a0\u00a0\"This is because your goal is just to learn English, and not to maintain your proficiency in your native language.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Duffy, the proposition's emphasis on preserving students' bilingual status is important for America.\r\n\r\n\"The goal [for the students] should be that upon graduating from high school, they should be a strong group of bilingual students,\" Duffy said.\u00a0\"In America, we need people who speak more than one language, so why not use the native abilities of immigrant students?\"\r\n\r\nDuffy said that although the proposition has its benefits, for some communities who have diverse\u00a0immigrant populations, it may be impractical.\r\n\r\n\"Here in California we have a diverse group of students who speak a wide\u00a0variety of languages, so it wouldn't be very practical to have a program for each native language,\" Duffy said. \"It's unfair to say that we can help students who speak one language over those who speak another, which can make the process\u00a0difficult.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Paly Spanish teacher Pilar Alonso, who taught English to young Latino\u00a0children, a bilingual program is important for helping students learn English while still maintaining their cultural roots.\r\n\r\n\"The bilingual program [at which Alonso\u00a0worked] was initially started because there was no system to help kindergarten students with no English speaking experience become integrated\u00a0into a fully English school system,\" Alonso said.\u00a0\"The goal was that the students would learn English over the course of four\u00a0years, and during that time they also learned to read in their own language,\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Alonso, each year the classes gradually transitioned from Spanish to English until the students were able to make the leap into standard English classes.\r\n\r\n\"Kindergarten classes were carried out 90 percent in Spanish, and 10 percent in English,\" Alonso said.\u00a0\"By the time they were in third grade, the students would be enrolled in the fully English courses.\"\r\n\r\nAlonso said that the bilingual education was crucial in preparing the students for success, while helping them draw connections between two languages and cultures.\r\n\r\n\"The program worked phenomenally because the kids left completely prepared, and transitioned what they learned about their own languages to English,\" Alonso said.\u00a0\"Bilingual students\u00a0need this kind of support in school.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the passing of the proposition, the state will now be tasked with implementing these bilingual programs into public schools.","excerpt":"California's public schools will provide diverse options for elementary level students seeking proficiency in the English language after a proposition removing the mandate of exclusively English education was passed on the state ballot last week.","date":"2016-11-16 18:40:53","author":"William Sallomi","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Alonso.jpg","categories":["Global Outlook","News","Uncategorized"],"tags":["education","election","Jose Ezcurra","Kevin Duffy","language","Pilar Alonso","Prop 58"]},{"id":125968,"title":"The aftermath of the election: Healing a divided country","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/15\/the-aftermath-of-the-election-healing-a-divided-country\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_125969\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/15053216_1175480745861345_1744188533_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-125969\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/15053216_1175480745861345_1744188533_o.jpg\" alt=\"15053216_1175480745861345_1744188533_o\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" \/><\/a> Students from multiple high schools around San Francisco lead a walk out in front of City Hall on Thursday in opposition to\u00a0the election of Donald Trump as president. The students chanted \"I believe that love will win,\" and \"the people make the city.\" Photo: Emilia Diaz-Magaloni[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the days leading up to the election, our parents, American immigrants, prepared themselves to vote for the first time as new citizens of this country.\u00a0They were already Americans in the broad sense, having raised their families here and created a life for themselves, teaching their children the American ideals of democracy, freedom and inalienable rights. They raised us in a society based on the principles of respect and tolerance. A society that allowed us to remain culturally faithful to our roots and yet still live a life plentiful in liberty, justice and the pursuit of happiness. However, as an immigrant, there is always a feeling of exclusion between the country you are from and the one you live in. Our families'<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0relationship with these two sides of our\u00a0identities are often confusing, sometimes angry.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet the day they cast their ballots, they felt unquestionably American, and for once there were\u00a0no reservations attached to that feeling of patriotism.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On election night, as votes rolled in we all sat in disbelief, in tears and in fear. The man who is now president-elect had targeted both of our cultures directly. We had watched on television as he claimed that all Mexicans were rapists and that most\u00a0Muslims were terrorists, that he had plans to deport all illegal immigrants and that he planned to ban all Muslims from entering this country. The validity or extent to which these statements can be carried out does not matter. It is the fact that they were said on this incredibly powerful national platform, and that people chose to accept them or turn a blind eye to them. Therein lies our fear.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donald Trump's victory speaks of a profound division in this country. It is a division between the white working class and the people who used to be in power. It is a division between targeted minorities and white America. For the marginalized white working class, a group of people left profoundly alone and afraid, this was their revolution, but also their call for help. In the same way, the groups of people targeted by the president-elect are now alone and extremely afraid. The result of this division is hate \u2014 hate on both sides that refuse to see the plight of the other. In the aftermath of this election, we braced ourselves for the angry social media posts from both sides, threats elevated in power by the anonymity of the screen. In our liberal \u201caccepting\u201d Palo Alto community, countless fingers angrily pointed at people who had voted for the president-elect, making them the enemy. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We felt the same anger that day, in disbelief that someone could support a man who represented the epitome of white supremacy, bigotry and racism. But we were also part of the problem. As we spoke out against hatred we created hatred. As people forgot to put a face to the those they were directing their hatred towards morality was left behind.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125970\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"434\"]<img class=\"wp-image-125970\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/15049627_1175480739194679_759626863_n-1.jpg\" alt=\"15049627_1175480739194679_759626863_n (1)\" width=\"434\" height=\"244\" \/> During the walk-out at City Hall, high school students shared their stories amid cheering crowds and supportive peers.

At Gunn High School, Latino women were taunted by white males on three separate occasions according to a Facebook post shared by Palo Alto High School senior Santiago Ruiz. The media has exploded with multiple very real cases of hate speech in close proximity to our community.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Thursday after the election we went on a sociology field trip to learn about homelessness in San Fransisco. Our teacher Benjamin Bolanos bravely led our class into this adventure, despite the grief we had all felt the day before.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the city streets that day, we witnessed a man scream \u201cI knew no\u00a0bitch could run this country,\u201d trying to provoke our class.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we walked away from the man who had intended to intimidate us with his hate, we were embraced by the loving community of San Francisco. Although we felt alone, helpless and angry, the city filled us with love and kindness. The calming aftermath of a storm.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, we encountered a man named Del. Del approached us in a flashy suit, a brown fedora and an American flag pin. The swagger and charm in his voice was captured in his story of triumph. Del had spent a long time homeless on University Avenue in Palo Alto and was now a leader of a movement to end homelessness in the city. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also met Kelly, and the little dog nestled in the pocket of her backpack. Kelly was fighting against homelessness as well. She daringly led our class of 30 high school juniors\u00a0and seniors\u00a0through the streets of San Francisco, showing us a raw and real city that moved us to tears, while spreading a message of growth and a focus on doing good.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125971\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"393\"]<img class=\"gr-progress wp-image-125971\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/15049931_1175480732528013_981591586_n.jpg\" alt=\"15049931_1175480732528013_981591586_n\" width=\"393\" height=\"219\" \/> A female high school student raises a sign reading \"My body my choice\" during the walk out at City Hall. Photo: Emilia Diaz-Magaloni[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We stopped to sit on the lawns of City Hall, listening to the chants of children saying \u201cI hate Trump.\u201d Although at first, we laughed, we were also taken aback by the toll that this election had taken on families and even children. As a completely unplanned event on this trip, we joined a peaceful walk-out lead b<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">y high school students in front of city hall. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were enveloped in rainbow colors, in flags of every country and a message of love. The high school students in our area were speaking out, and their main message was against hate. A high school girl shared her story in the middle of the protest. Next to her stood two middle-aged African American men and a group of Latin American bikers, as well as high school students wrapped up in the colors of the rainbow, all listening intently and nodding their heads. This scene of love and empowerment stayed with us as we continued on to our next location.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We entered <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">St. Boniface Church<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the center to the <a href=\"http:\/\/thegubbioproject.org\/\">Gubbio project<\/a>, and were immediately enveloped \u00a0in the scent of incense. The Gubbio project is an organization dedicated to giving the homeless population a place to sleep in the city. The pews were filled with rows and rows of resting people, basking in the colorful light coming from the large stained glass window.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Del's words, Kelly\u2019s strength, the power of protest, the kindness of the Gubbio project and Bolanos' bravery, small acts in the name of decency and humanity, managed to inspire so much good, which led us to a new conclusion.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125973\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"385\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/15049931_1175480732528013_981591586_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-125973\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/15044709_1175480775861342_330741660_o.jpg\" alt=\"15044709_1175480775861342_330741660_o\" width=\"385\" height=\"288\" \/><\/a> A mural in Clarion Alley in the midst of the Mission District depicts a powerful message voicing the desires of the people to make housing affordable and end gentrification.

We do not have control over the results of this election anymore. We must respect the system that we trusted to elect presidents like Barack Obama, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we do have control over is the way we react. We do not believe in just accepting this outcome blindly. As Hillary Clinton said, \u201cfighting for what\u2019s right is always worth it.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But we must remember that spreading hate from the roots of frustration and disbelief serves only to divide this country further. We must take the results of this election and the sparks that have been ignited and turn this into a powerful message. A message to those who feel alone and marginalized that they are accepted and loved by those around them regardless of the results of the election. We must teach each other that all people, regardless of color, race, sexual orientation, national origin, religious belief and gender are equal and deserving. We must teach each other to advocate for humanity and not just the portion of humanity that we personally identify with. In the midst of hate, we must be the ones to love, regardless of who you voted for. This is not about the election anymore, this is about healing a divided country. Donald Trump does not decide the direction that America goes in\u2014 that is for us to decide and for us to work on.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125972\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"296\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/15049931_1175480732528013_981591586_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-125972\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/15065068_1175480765861343_772885374_o.jpg\" alt=\"15065068_1175480765861343_772885374_o\" width=\"296\" height=\"395\" \/><\/a> Celebrating the diversity of San Francisco a Mural in Clarion Alley reads \"We all deserve a healthy and safe community.\" Photo: Emilia Diaz-Magaloni[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the first time our parents cast their ballot in America and their feelings shifted from pride to shame and anger.

The bond, which will be paid off over 35 years, will cost the state a total of about $17.6 billion because of the interest on the $9 billion principle. Junior Maya Rebitzer was against Prop. 51 because she feels that it is aimed towards helping construction companies in California rather than school districts.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn general, it\u2019s better to have more locally funded schools because it is more efficient with the money, and it holds people more accountable when it\u2019s local funding rather than state funding,\u201d Rebitzer said. \u201cThe way this proposition is worded does not specify how the money is distributed. School districts just apply for it, and because of that, the richer districts who can afford to hire consultants are more likely to get the money than the districts who actually need it.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the ballot had two propositions regarding the death penalty, giving California the choice between speeding up or repealing the process. Sophomore Claire Chen is glad that Prop. 66 won and the death penalty will be sped up because she believes it will help reduce the amount of money spent on a process that many consider slow.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think there has to be a death penalty, but it also has to get sped up or it has to cost us way less money because right now we\u2019re spending hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to keep these prisoners who have committed murders in prison, and I don\u2019t think we should be spending this much money on that,\u201d Chen said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, junior Reza Navadeh disagrees, and thinks speeding up the death penalty will leave more room for error.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think that it is not good to have a faster death row, and I believe that it is worth the tax dollars to keep innocent people alive rather than to possibly getting the wrong guy,\u201d Navadeh said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navadeh also thinks that the passage of Prop. 64, which legalized recreational marijuana for people ages 21 and over, has potential benefits and drawbacks.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think that it will be very interesting to see how the marijuana industry in California will increase an already huge California economy,\u201d Navadeh said. \u201cBut it seems that there are a lot of issues with its legalization. It is predicted that there will be harsher punishments for minors with marijuana, and that the price will increase, which would be bad for medical users. I think that it's about time we see weed legalized in California, and I\u2019m interested in seeing if this will overall lead to a good or bad for outcome for consumers.\u201d\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prop. 55, which was passed by a 24.2 percent margin, extends the income tax increase that was voted for in 2012 via Prop. 30. This increased the taxes by one to three percent for people with annual incomes over $263,000. Prop. 55 extended the increase to those who make over $250,000 a year, and will be in effect until 2030.
