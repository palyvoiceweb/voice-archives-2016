The Vikings defeated Santa Clara High School (4-5-3) 4-0 on Senior Night last Friday at Paly.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings held possession fiercely throughout the match, ultimately scoring once in the first half and three times in the second. The first goal was an own goal, when a throw-in by junior Talia Malchin bounced off a Santa Clara defender's head and into the goal. Sophomore Emily Tomz scored the second with an assist from senior captain Heidi Moeser. Senior Alison Lu scored twice, with the second goal occurring within 20 seconds of the first. Santa Clara held strong the first half, blocking seven goal attempts by Paly, but continuously lost possession after halftime.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings now set their sights on improving in preparation for CCS.\r\n\r\n\"Although we won, and morale is high, there are definitely things we need to improve on before CCS,\" Moeser said. \"I think we could work on capitalizing on set plays and corner kicks. We can always continue to work on our communication and playing the simple passes.\"\r\n\r\nWith a near perfect record, except for a loss to Mountain View High School (10-0-2), the Vikings constantly strive to progress.\r\n\r\nAccording to Tomz the Vikings bounced back from the Mountain View loss quickly, and focus on\u00a0preparing for CCS.\r\n\r\n\"Although we didn't have a perfect season, we played extremely well, \" Tomz said. \"We let in few goals, scored a heck of a lot of them, and overall we should be proud of a really great season. Of course, our loss to Mountain View [High School] was a downer, but we bounced back and finished strong. Now we push on and set our sights for a CCS victory.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Night was dedicated to celebrating the six starting seniors on the team. \u00a0Assistant Coach Eric Seedman says each senior has her own strength.\r\n\r\n\"Linnea was huge for us this year as goalie,\" Seedman said. \"Ansley is the hardest worker and foundation of our midfield, Alison is an amazing aggressive defender, Jacey is an incredible player and great team leader, Nika is a fantastic winger, is fast and scores often, and Heidi holds strong as a center forward and is a great motivational caption. These six seniors are an incredible part of the team, and next year we will miss them on and off the field.\"\r\n\r\nSeedman says the Vikings are ready to take on the challenge of CCS.\r\n\r\n\"The season isn't over yet. We still have Open Division of CCS, and we are motivated, pumped up and ready to go,\" Seedman Said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will\u00a0have their first CCS playoff game at Archbishop Mitty High School (13-2-5)1 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 27 at San Jose.","excerpt":"Girls' soccer defeated Santa Clara High School 4-0 during Senior Night, and is currently setting its sights on a CCS win.

Sometimes stories are hidden not because people are unaware, but because they are afraid to speak. Such stories often take an emotional toll on journalists, who may face backlash from the public and those targeted by the press. The scandal with the Catholic Church, which involved the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by priests, is one such example. While \u201cSpotlight\u201d \u00a0encompasses stellar acting and a dramatic script, it falls slightly flat due to an underwhelming conclusion and meager character development.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSpotlight\u201d tells the true story of an investigative journalism team from the Boston Globe\u2019s \u2018Spotlight\u2019 section, and how they uncovered sexual abuse cases perpetrated by religious figures nearly 20 years ago. The priests' actions went unpunished due to fearful victims and determined Church members such as the\u00a0Archbishop of Boston, Bernard Law (Len Cariou). The team encountered constant pushback from community members, especially those with strong ties to the Catholic Church. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time the team published the story, they had enough damaging evidence that the issue couldn\u2019t be swept under the rug,\u00a0with proof of over 100\u00a0cases of sexual abuse by priests and a strong suspicion that the system allowed such behavior.<\/span>\r\n\r\nDirector Tom McCarthy maintains\u00a0a fast pace with smooth scene changes that not only keeps the audience interested by\u00a0the influx of information but also creates a contrast in emotions. In one scene, journalists Rezendes\u00a0and Pfeiffer\u00a0are both conducting interviews with victims in two different places, with two different men. The emotions of the victims\u2019 testimonies are amplified by the scene switching from one man to the other, making it painfully clear how so few victims survive the mental strain of\u00a0reliving\u00a0their experiences. The camera zoomed in on faces, allowing small facial expressions to convey sadness and shame instead of just using words. Scene switches were also accompanied by a melodic, soft piano\u00a0music that adds a somber tone, but at times, it is more distracting than helpful.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The constant tension in a dogged chase for information, and high turmoil of emotions comes to life with a talented cast. Walter \u201cRobby\u201d Robinson (Michael Keaton), the editor in charge of the Spotlight team, struggles with opposition from friends over the decision to write the story and helps provide context to the Spotlight team\u2019s acceptance of the case. Mike Rezendes and Sacha Pfeiffer stand out among the cast, with the script placing most of its focus on their efforts to track down scandals within the Catholic Church. Their dramatic efforts to uncover a string of abuse help dramatize the plot and connect the audience to its emotional undertones. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) demonstrates the struggle of citizens against groups or organizations to promote justice as a strict but virtuous lawyer who was previously unable to derail the Church\u2019s consistent cover-ups. Editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), who pushes the Spotlight team to focus on the story, serves a limited yet important role and his gruff personality juxtaposes those of his fellow writers.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While all actors expertly performed their roles, character development was limited throughout. \u201cSpotlight\u201d offered little context to address why each character was pursuing the story and their goals in the process. In addition, the film\u2019s large cast ensured that it was difficult to fully comprehend each character\u2019s background, motives and desires. Other factors limited \u201cSpotlight's\u201d coherency. The convoluted plot created confusion because so many names were thrown around. Much of the action was conveyed through the dialogue, so it was easy to miss the investigation\u2019s details.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie raises one very important question, but never fully answered it: Why wasn\u2019t the story covered earlier, when the scandals first occurred? Lawyers and victims told the Globe that they had sent the information years ago, but they never mentioned what had happened to it. An unclear conclusion, amplified by the final scene\u2019s underwhelming representation of a busy office, negatively affected the movie\u2019s clarity and the urgency of the story being written.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSpotlight\u201d combines a stellar cast with an intense plot to create a unique look into the world of journalism. This thriller was not only enjoyable to watch, but also informative because of the in-depth look into the Catholic Church scandal. \u201cSpotlight\u201d provides depth by illuminating one of the greatest challenges we face today: Shining the spotlight on issues some would rather leave covered up.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Spotlight\"<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2 hours, 9 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated: R for some language including sexual references.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by Tom McCarthy<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Starring: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Live Schrieber, John Slattery and Brian D'arcy James<\/strong>","excerpt":"The stellar cast and dramatic plot line contributes to the film's emotional appeal and propelled it to earn six Academy Award nominations.

Getting stuck on the reddish-brown planet is even more inconceivable. The Oscar-nominated film \"The Martian,\" directed by Ridley Scott, tells the thrilling story of a man who gets stuck on Mars and fights to survive against all odds.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on a novel by author Andy Weir, and follows the story of an astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who is mistakenly left on Mars by his team following a bad storm. Due to limited supplies, Watney has to use his background in botany to find a way to grow food on the desolate planet and survive until National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and his team can rescue him. This film takes the notion of man versus nature to the next level.\r\n\r\nAcademy Award-winning actor Matt Damon leads an all-star cast including big industry names like Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain and Sean Bean. Damon does an exceptional job of adopting the character of Watney, a desperate but cool-headed man. He also does a phenomenal job conveying Watney\u2019s loneliness, which is depicted in one of the first scenes where Watney stirs back to consciousness after the disaster only to realize he has to survive on his own.\u00a0He also displays a multitude of emotions throughout the film, intertwining well-timed humor and creativity in an extremely unfortunate situation.\r\n\r\nDespite the lack of a human villain, the film\u2019s plot is quite gripping due to Damon\u2019s outstanding portrayal of a man trying to brave the unknown elements and a script that balances timely comedy and action. The supporting cast also does a fine job in complementing Damon as Daniels, Wiig, Bean, Chastain and Ejiofor all step up to create an fresh alternative view of Watney\u2019s struggle from NASA Headquarters on Earth. Actor Danny Glover, also known as Childish Gambino under his rap name, also makes a cameo in the film, which is an exciting sight for his musical fans.\r\n\r\nOne of the film's main strength is in its visual effects, something that the film industry which has been recognized and therefore nominated the movie for the Oscar category of Best Visual Effects. Amazing landscape shots by Scott not only highlight the loneliness that Watney experiences on the planet, but also the haunting beauty of the Red Planet.\r\n\r\n\"The Martian\" should be lauded for the balance it has between visual effects and scientific accuracy, specifically when it comes to the setting. To faithfully recreate the planet Mars, British visual effects company, Framestone, worked with NASA to make sure that specific features, such as the sky and terrain, were as realistic as possible. Scott also worked meticulously to make sure that the film accurately represented what could happen in real life. For example, the main plot line regarding Watney\u2019s attempt to grow food on the planet was approved by real life experts like astrophysicist Michael Shara who, when speaking to the New York Post, said, \u201cWe could probably grow something on Mars.\u201d Despite minor scientific accuracy errors, like the exaggerated effects of the wind storm that begins the film, Scott does an applaudable job that will please both moviegoers who are looking forward to the thrilling story and those who are looking forward to the science.\r\n\r\n\"The Martian\" is a thrilling story worthy of its seven nominations. However, while it should be competitive in many of the categories, the most deserving and most likely award for \"The Martian\" should be in the Visual Effects category, a category won by last year\u2019s space drama \"Interstellar.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Martian\" is one of the newer editions of a series of space thrillers, following the recent blockbusters \"Interstellar\" and \"Gravity.\" However, \"The Martian\" distinguishes itself from both of the films as it is more engaging than \"Gravity\" but less emotional \u2013 and less bizarre \u2013 than \"Interstellar.\" Overall, it is a captivating movie and a must-watch for all, especially science aficionados.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>\u201cThe Martian\u201d<\/strong><\/strong>\r\n\r\n2 hours, 24 minutes\r\n\r\nPG-13 (for some strong language, injury images, and brief nudity)\r\n\r\nDirected by Ridley Scott\r\n\r\nWith Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Pe\u00f1a, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Donald Glover.\r\n\r\nOscar Nominations: Best Picture, Actor in a Leading Role (Matt Damon), Visual Effects, Sound Editing, Writing (Adapted Screenplay), Sound Mixing and Production Design.","excerpt":"Going to Mars is an unthinkable proposition for all of mankind; getting stuck on the reddish-brown planet is even more inconceivable.
