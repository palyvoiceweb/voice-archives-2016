Photo: Julia Qiao[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAlthough they may not always train or play together, sophomore Michael Chau and junior Flavia Stiglich are connected by a deeper bond \u2013 their love for badminton.\r\n\r\nIn a short amount of time at Palo Alto High School, Stiglich and Chau have become close friends through their many discussions about their badminton experiences. Both are highly successful players: Chau is nationally ranked in the United States and Stiglich is a member of the Peruvian National Badminton Team.\r\n\r\nTogether, these newcomers have led Paly's badminton team to one of its best seasons in years, including successful showings at the California Interscholastic Federation Northern California Tournament over the weekend.\r\n\r\nChau and senior Eric Chiang placed third in the boys\u2019 double division at CIF-Norcal in San Jose, according to Chau. Senior Priya Misner and junior Stiglich also made it into quarterfinals before falling to a team from Carlmont. Chau and Chiang were seeded third heading into Saturday\u2019s tournament after placing second at Central Coast Section finals and first at Santa Clara Valley Athletic League, according to Chau.\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael Chau: Leader by example\r\n<\/strong>\r\n\r\nChau joined the Vikings this year and quickly helped lead the team to victory. Currently, he is ranked 32nd in the Under-19 age group for Boys' Singles. To be nationally ranked, players must compete in many USA Badminton tournaments. At his peak, Chau was ranked 19th in the nation is his age group playing Boys' Singles.\r\n\r\nChau's mother introduced him to the sport at the age of eight, hoping that he would play a sport that he could not get injured in. Having fallen in love with the sport, Chau has spent the last eight years practicing and honing his technique. He hopes to follow his passion and continue badminton far into the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy ultimate goal is to go to the Olympics, but I do not really know if that will happen,\u201d Chau said. \u201cIt seems really far away, but you have to dream to keep going.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeyond the national tournaments and Olympic dream, Chau has found his spot on Paly\u2019s badminton team. According to assistant coach Arne Lim, he was able to carry the team\u2019s spirit and boost its moral.\r\n\r\n\u201cMichael did not win every single time, yet every time he played, everyone watched him,\u201d Lim said. \u201cWe usually tried to set his match early in the tournament so it [his match] sets the tone for the team, because when he won, everyone said, \u2018Okay, we can do this.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nChau\u2019s talent is well known throughout the team and many members value his expertise.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is kind of a team leader without a title,\u201d Lim said. \u201cHe leads through example and skill. He is a nice guy and a very good team player as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Flavia Stiglich: Leader by teaching\r\n<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Vikings also saw the addition of member Flavia Stiglich, who moved from Peru in December 2015. Although she no longer practices with the Peruvian National Badminton Team, she still represents Peru in international competition, including the Pan American Junior Competition, which she has competed in since 2011, and the World Junior Championships, which she competed in since 2015. Stiglich also represents her country at many Southern American tournaments\u00a0and has been doing so since 2011.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best feeling is when I compete with other countries and compete for my country,\u201d Stiglich said. \u201cBecause then, you are no longer playing for yourself, but also for your country. When you win something, you are serving something bigger than yourself, and that feeling is something I just cannot describe.\u201d\r\n\r\nStiglich first started badminton at the age of 10, and after two years of practice, she decided to try out for the national badminton team in 2011. At first glance, it seems as though Stiglich\u2019s path has been relatively smooth, reaching national success after two years. However, Stiglich has had to overcome many barriers, the biggest being herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore the qualification for the World Junior Championships in 2015, I played a tournament to qualify to the 2015 South American Tournament and did not do as well as expected,\u201d Stiglich said. \u201cMy mental game was off ... so my game was not the level it should have been. During the time between the South American and Worlds qualifications, I had a tough time thinking that I was not going to make it to Worlds and that I was not good enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nStiglich admits that she thought about quitting badminton\u00a0but ultimately decided to continue working towards her goal.\r\n\r\n\u201cI learned to never give up on my dreams,\u201d Stiglich said. \u201cAfter working on my mental strength and confidence, I was able to overcome all the negative thoughts. When the World Junior Championship qualification tournament came around, I was ready to do my best and qualified to represent my country at the championships.\u201d\r\n\r\nLike Chau, Stiglich found her place on the team and soon became a valuable leader on and off the court.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is willing to teach others who are willing to listen,\u201d Lim said. \u201cShe is willing to take some time to root them on, to be part of the team and really support the women who are on our team. People like her a lot and she has got a wonderful personality. She has a very strong charisma that is poised and confident while not overbearing. ... She leads by her knowledge and help.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith Chau and Stiglich at the helm, the team will already have a strong start by the time the spring badminton season rolls around, despite assistant coach Arne Lim leaving.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe expect to have a great season next year,\u201d Lim said. \u201cFlavia is only a junior and Michael is only a sophomore, so they will be playing for us next year as well. We also have some people who are returning next year who took this year off, which will add to our team. It will be a season to watch out for.\u201d","excerpt":"Although they may not always train or play together, sophomore Michael Chau and junior Flavia Stiglich are connected by a deeper bond \u2013 their love for badminton.","date":"2016-05-26 22:31:03","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Flavia-and-michael.jpg","categories":["A&amp;E Section Spotlight","Badminton","Features","Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["#norcal","Arne Lim","badminton","CIF-Norcal","Flavia Stiglich","Michael Chau","paly","season recap","states"]},{"id":120671,"title":"School board representatives to obtain preferential vote","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/26\/school-board-representatives-to-obtain-preferential-vote\/","content":"Pending approval at a meeting in June,\u00a0Board of Education student\u00a0representatives will cast preferential votes during Palo Alto Unified School District board meetings\u00a0starting next school year.\r\n\r\nAccording to Supt.

Teachers and board members have been negotiating matters in regards to teacher salary for months, according to board member Melissa Baten-Caswell. The contract will enact a 5 percent raise from July 2015 for this year, a 4\u00a0percent\u00a0raise in the 2016-17 school year and a 3 percent\u00a0raise in 2017-18. It will also include bonuses to teacher salaries that depend on property tax growth in the area.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the presence of a crowd of Palo Alto Educators Association members, Baten-Caswell expressed her support for the contract.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI am completely in support of this contract,\u201d Baten-Caswell said. \u201cThe thing that makes the biggest difference\u00a0isn\u2019t the buildings textbooks or class sizes, but the teachers.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Dauber, the 12 percent increase is much less desirable than his proposed 9\u00a0percent\u00a0increase, as a smaller increase would allow the district to hire approximately 35 additional teachers, which would decrease class size.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt [the contract] doesn\u2019t strike the balance that we need between reducing class size and continuing\u00a0to get excellent teachers,\u201d Dauber said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board member Camille Townsend denied\u00a0Dauber claim about teacher salary increase linking to\u00a0decreasing class size, which was largely supported by those who attended the meeting.

According to Ozman, paying teachers less will not equate to being able to hire more of them, as potential teachers will be deterred by the salaries that do not cater to the high living costs in the area.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to board member Terry Godfrey, the contract will be beneficial and affordable for the district.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe [the district] currently have $30 million in reserves,\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cMuch of that is for economic uncertainty \u2026 so that we can make deals and negotiations like this.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raising teacher pay allows for the district to be a desirable place for teachers to be employed, according to board president Heidi Emberling.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLet us continue to be a destination district for educators,\u201d Emberling said.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education approved a contract to increase teacher salary by 12 percent over the next three years on Tuesday in the board chambers at the district office.\r\n","date":"2016-05-26 18:50:56","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_5475.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["district","PAUSD","raise","Salary","School Board","Teacher"]},{"id":120815,"title":"Global math phenoms strike again","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/26\/global-math-phenoms-strike-again\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_121046\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"575\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_43931.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-121046\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_43931.jpg\" alt=\"Seniors Eric Foster, Andrew Lee, Kathryn Li and Allison Zhang pose for a picture after winning the International Math Modeling Competition last July.

In return, the race organizers pay a regular fee to the insurance company. Our paper developed a mathematical model that tells insurance companies how much they should charge and tells race organizers the conditions under which it makes financial sense for them to buy, or not buy, that insurance.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zhang attributes the team\u2019s strong performance to its perseverance, as they had to start over multiple times.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cCompeting in a 5-day challenge is a lot like running a marathon,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cBy the end of our time allotted, all of us were exhausted and incoherent in our speech. In almost each of our competitions, we would find a possible solution, only to discover later that it had a fatal flaw. Initially, we were extremely frustrated, but as we became more experienced, we also got used to starting over after failure. I think the ability to rebound is important as a life skill, and for this reason would strongly encourage anyone interested in mathematics to try a math modeling competition, because it really builds perseverance.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Lee, the team felt more prepared for the competition this year than last year. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Another year of math courses, programming classes, and developing problem solving skills in general helped immensely,\" Lee said. \"Last year, we struggled far more with both the development of an abstract solution as well as the technical implementation of our algorithm. This year, there was not as much lag time between reading the problem and completing a thorough response. As a result, we had a lot more time to polish the writing and explanations in the paper. We definitely feel that the last couple hours we spent thoroughly proofreading our paper improved its quality and appeal to the judges.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has used its experience in previous math classes and competitions to incorporate more advanced mathematics into their its solutions, according to Foster.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur model in this paper had a natural opening for the use of partial derivatives, something we only learned in math a few months back,\u201d Foster said. \u201cWe wouldn't have been able to use this in our previous papers because we didn't know how, but they became an important part of our solution for this latest contest, showing how our papers can improve not just with practice but with more exposure to math, as well.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Foster, although the results of the competition are presented as a reflection of the work the team put into the contest, the results are just as much of what they have learned in their math classes throughout Paly.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI'm grateful to have such talented and hardworking teammates in addition to having the support of the math department and the school as we participate in these contests,\u201d Foster said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foster recommends that any students interested in math to try the High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt's [the contest is] fun and also a great way to take what you've learned for so long in school and apply it to a real-world problem that requires math for its solution and, in many cases has not yet been satisfactorily solved,\u201d Foster said. \u201cPaly's Analysis, AB, BC, MV [Multivariable] Calculus, and Statistics courses provide any interested students with the needed mathematical foundations for these contests, and I'm confident any student who can succeed in those courses can succeed in these contests, as well.\"<\/span>","excerpt":"A team of four Palo Alto High School seniors were notified on May 17 that they have been selected as one of the two US representatives for the International Math Modeling Competition, according to math instructional supervisor Radu Toma.\r\n","date":"2016-05-26 11:08:32","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_43931.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["allison","andrew","contest","eric","foster","kathryn","lee","li","math","modeling","radu","toma","win","Zhang"]},{"id":120948,"title":"District plans overhaul of standardized test administration","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/25\/district-plans-overhaul-of-standardized-test-administration\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_120958\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"562\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_5419.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-120958\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_5419.png\" alt=\"IMG_5419\" width=\"562\" height=\"421\" \/><\/a> Gunn High School school board representative senior Grace Park expressed her thoughts regarding students' frustration of retaking AP exams in her last board meeting. \"The atmosphere on campus is that students are dealing with this simply because that is the only option,\" Park said.
