[{"id":116100,"title":"County to begin health investigation","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/13\/county-to-begin-health-investigation\/","content":"The Santa Clara County Public Health Department is scheduled to start field work later this month in its Epi-Aid project that will look into suicide data for local school districts, according to Public Health officials who spoke at the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education meeting on Tuesday in the district office.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pam Stoddard, director of research for Public Health at the Santa Clara County Public Health Department, the Epi-Aid for Santa Clara County is aimed to combat suicides and the issues that surround it in the county, because of the strong of suicides among incoming, current and alumni members of PAUSD from 2009-2015.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn \u2018Epi-Aid\u2019, or epidemiological assistance, is an investigation of an urgent public health problem,\u201d Stoddard said to the board. \u201cThe CDC [Center for disease control] has this mechanism in place so that state and local public health officials can request assistance with these urgent problems because they may not have the local capacity or subject matter expertise to fully address them. The goal is to determine the causes and the extent of the problem, so these are really about developing prevention and control recommendations.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe preparation period for the Epi-Aid occurred during December and January, and will now move on to the fieldwork portion of the project, which is scheduled to take place from February 16-29, according to Stoddard. Stoddard says that when this stage is completed, a follow-up stage will take place.\r\n\r\nThe Epi-Aid is aimed at giving the county short term-assistance by providing epidemiology-focused objectives and recommendations, which are based on the incidence, distribution and possible control of health issues, according to Stoddard.\r\n\r\n\u201cFocusing on the county\u00a0will\u00a0provide us some flexibility in comparing cities and school districts within the county to see if we can understand more about patterns and trends,\u201d Stoddard said. \"The main goal is to make some recommendations on prevention strategies that can be used in the school district, the city and the county.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe investigation will also include a review of media coverage, prevention activities and protocols used by communities and school districts, comparing them to national recommendations around suicide prevention, according to Stoddard.\r\n\r\nThe Epi-Aid staff will not be allowed to conduct any new research but can take data from the county coroner\u2019s office, death certificates, hospital data, school surveys and 911 calls, according to Stoddard. Additionally, the CDC will be able to design objectives, provide technical assistance, complete a wide-range media scan to ensure safe reporting, meet with local agencies, analyze data, draft reports and provide feedback and recommendations for the county and city, according to Stoddard.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is an epidemiological approach, so it doesn\u2019t use methods like psychological autopsies, so they won\u2019t be able to investigate individual deaths,\u201d Stoddard said.","excerpt":"The Santa Clara County Public Health Department is scheduled to start field work in its Epi-Aid project for local school districts, according to Public Health Department officials at the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education meeting on Tuesday at the district office.","date":"2016-02-13 17:30:17","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMAG0439.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["cdc","center for disease control and prevention","district office","epi-aid","Palo Alto Unified School District","palo alto unified school district board of education","public health department","School Board"]},{"id":116278,"title":"Students showcase work in Arts in Unusual Places","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/13\/students-showcase-work-in-arts-in-unusual-places\/","content":"<hr \/>\r\n\r\nVisual and performing arts students showcased their talents in demonstrations during the annual Art in Unusual Places celebration at Palo Alto High School.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/social.shorthand.com\/thepalyvoice\/embed\/jgcstJdSbf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"Visual and performing arts students showcased their talents in demonstrations during the annual Art in Unusual Places celebration at Palo Alto High School.\r\n","date":"2016-02-13 00:27:45","author":"Emilia Diaz-Magaloni","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/12735685_1668667386726622_1927706921_n-12.jpg","categories":["Multimedia"],"tags":["Andy Goldsworthy","art","art in unusual places","Claudio Malagrino","Elizabeth Wilkinson","josh code","Kaitlyn Nakamura","Keith Haring","najar","steve ferrera"]},{"id":116173,"title":"Admin removes James Franco mural from Student Center","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/11\/admin-removes-james-franco-mural-from-student-center\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_116177\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"592\"]<img class=\"wp-image-116177\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/james-franco-mural1.jpg\" alt=\"james franco mural\" width=\"592\" height=\"395\" \/> One of James Franco's murals on the Student Center was painted over yesterday evening. \"Our art department is working with some students on other murals to put up around campus,\" Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio said.

Larson is nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her captivating\u00a0performance as a woman kidnapped for seven years. Photo: A24 films.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to imagine living in just one room for seven years. It\u2019s even harder to imagine turning the survival story of the woman held captive and the coming-of-age story of her son into a successful, uplifting movie. Instead of portraying a tragedy as yet another emotionally draining drama, \u201cRoom\u201d manages to find hope in the horrifying, resulting in a powerful film that carries the weight necessary to contend with the other great works in its Oscars nomination category.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cRoom,\u201d based on the New York Times bestselling book of the same title by Emma Donoghue, tells the story of 17-year-old Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) who is kidnapped and held in a shack for seven years by her kidnapper Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). In that time, she gives birth to a boy named Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and raises him to the best of her ability, teaching him that their garden shed, Room, is all there is to the world. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the highlights and unique features of the movie is the fact that it is narrated by 5-year-old Jack. His innocent perspective not only provides optimism in a bleak situation, but also depth as he explains how Room is his world, and humor as he explains how aliens control heaven and birth. For such a young child actor, the depth of emotion accurately portrayed is nothing short of amazing. His dialogue is\u00a0also carefully constructed, taking into consideration how Jack bases his whole existence off one room. The outside world is simply \u201cspace\u201d and his disbelief in the existence of things like dogs and trees is communicated through his anger and fear manifesting in a tantrum and the words \u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d In other scenes, however, Jack plays with the childlike abandon shared by all 5-year-olds, resulting in a compelling character able to tie innocence and joy to what is by all accounts a nightmare.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Lenny Abrahamson, also nominated for an Oscar, utilizes camera angles and lighting to full effect. When Jack sees outside the room for the first time, the glaring light hitting the camera matches what his sensitive eyes would see. When he\u2019s crouched on the floor the camera also lowers, and when he\u2019s in argument with his mother the close-up facial shots convey the smallest changes in emotion. One issue with Abrahamson\u2019s use of the camera is that at certain times it feels overly realistic. Shaky cameras, when used in moderation, add to the performance, but in excess make the scene overwhelming for the wrong reasons.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all aspects of the movie, a clear effort to strip away the glamour of the traditional Hollywood drama is apparent: ordinarily beautiful Larson appears limp and pallid in soiled costumes, Old Nick is a rationalizing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, unemployed middle-aged man instead of the stereotypically violent aggressor, and Jack is not completely oblivious to the injustice of his situation despite his misunderstanding of the outside world. The movie gains gravitas from choosing to present moments that show this honesty, like shots of Jack listening to his mother\u2019s interactions with Old Nick at night, instead of the more stylized sequences often favored by other dramas.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the beautiful parts of the movie is\u00a0that the director does not\u00a0rely on dramatic music to make his points, and instead lets silence illustrate emotion. In one particular scene, as Joy contemplates the risk of her escape plan, her face, the rhythm of her breathing and her tightly clenched fists say it all.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Larson\u2019s performance is outstanding. Her character radiates the fierce maternal love so crucial to Jack\u2019s protection through the smallest glance or shift in tone. Her role encompasses nearly the entire range of human emotion in one film, and Larson meets each shift with underplayed intensity. From the very first opening shot, the audience is rooting for her, and though nothing like Joy\u2019s sacrifices are\u00a0experienced by Larson, Larson\u2019s character remains stunningly believable throughout the film.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, \u201cRoom\u201d is a film about perspective. As Jack and Ma lean on each other through their extreme escape, they realize the power of love and hope. Their ability to find the humor and excitement in everything, and their experience of looking at the world with fresh eyes is a valuable lesson in enjoying the little moments in life. \u201cRoom\u201d is a powerful, out of the box film about our ability to survive and adapt when all we have is love.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>\u201cRoom\u201d<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>1 hour, 58 minutes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Release Date: 16\u00a0October\u00a02015<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Rated: R\u00a0for language<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Directed by\u00a0Lenny Abrahamson<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Starring:\u00a0Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridgers<\/b>","excerpt":"Instead of turning a tragedy into yet another emotionally draining drama, \u201cRoom\u201d manages to find hope in the horrifying, creating a powerful film that carries the weight necessary to contend with the other great works in its Oscars category.","date":"2016-02-11 18:04:36","author":"Maya McNealis","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Room-2015-Lenny-Abrahamson-01-1024x614.jpg","categories":["Oscars 2016","Spotlight"],"tags":["best actress","brie larson","jacob tremblay","oscars","room"]},{"id":116185,"title":"Democrats to face off in debate","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/11\/democrats-to-face-off-in-debate\/","content":"Join The Paly Voice as we liveblog the Democratic debate between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders tonight at 6 p.m. on PBS.\r\n\r\n[liveblog]","excerpt":"Join The Paly Voice as we liveblog the Democratic debate between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders tonight at 6 p.m.","date":"2016-02-11 17:39:13","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/demdebate.jpg","categories":["News","Uncategorized"],"tags":["Bernie","Bernie Sanders","Clinton","Deabte","democrats","Hillary","Hillary Clinton","liveblog","Presidential race","Sanders"]},{"id":116058,"title":"Wrestling to attend SCVAL tournament this weekend","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/11\/wrestling-to-attend-scval-tournament-this-weekend\/","content":"<div class=\"gmail_default\">\n[caption width=\"614\" id=\"attachment_116136\" align=\"aligncenter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.57.57-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-116136\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.57.57-PM.png\" alt=\"Freshman Callum Day-Ham knocks down his opponent at the dual meet against Gunn on Thursday.

Photo by Sam Lee.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nA new student club is hoping to bring an end to mental illness stigma at Palo Alto High School.\r\n\r\nThe club, called Bring Change 2 Mind, was founded by three Paly students, seniors Bryn Carlson and Joseph Kao and freshman Lia Salvatierra, with the goal of creating awareness on the subject.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe each, for our own reasons, felt that something needed to be done on our campus to address mental health,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cThis club sprang up because we have a vision that mental health will be considered no different than physical health, that people will feel comfortable talking about mental health and will feel no hesitation in seeking help for themselves or a friend who is suffering.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Carlson, Bring Change 2 Mind is a national organization with the goal of ending the stigma.\r\n\r\nOn Friday during Club Day Two, the club hosted an activity in which students could write about why they want to end the stigma or how they hope mental health will be viewed in the near future. Carlson was very pleased with how the activity went.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe goal of this activity is the same as our club's overall goal: to get people talking about mental health and to create a space for people to open up about it in order to diminish the stigma,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cI am pretty pleased. We had a bigger turnout than I was expecting so that was exciting.\u201d\r\n\r\nCarlson hopes that the club's message can reach more people through the events it plans to host in the near future.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are going to be pretty active during March,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWe plan on doing some more activities out on the Quad, and then we are going to have some smaller campaigns that we are going to be launching. And then we are also very excited to go to a summit in April that is going to be basically like a conference other chapters of Bring Change 2 Mind from around the Bay Area. \u201c","excerpt":"A new student club, \u201cBring Change 2 Mind,\" is hoping to bring an end to mental illness stigma at Palo Alto High School.","date":"2016-02-09 11:18:10","author":"Chirag Akella","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/bring-change-2-mind-candid.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["Bring Change 2 Mind","carlson","club","Kao","mental illness","salvatierra","stigma"]},{"id":115714,"title":"&#8216;Brooklyn&#8217; redefines the meaning of hope","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/09\/brooklyn-redefines-the-meaning-of-hope\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115722\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"590\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screen-Shot-2016-02-04-at-7.34.52-AM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-115722\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screen-Shot-2016-02-04-at-7.34.52-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-04 at 7.34.52 AM\" width=\"590\" height=\"394\" \/><\/a> Saorise Ronan and Emory Cohen star in \"Brooklyn,\" a heartfelt story of a young Irish woman immigrating to New York.

There, she faces the same struggle as the millions of immigrants that traveled to the United States, which is the need to assimilate to an unfamiliar way of life and the melancholy yearning for a faraway home with no hopes of returning. Ellis begins to enjoy her life in New York more when she falls for a friendly Italian-American plumber, Tom (Emory Cohen). However, after Ellis visits her hometown, she is faced with temptations from a local, Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson), and is torn between the two lovers.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viewers easily connect with the protagonist and are engrossed by Lacey\u2019s captivating journey to overcome\u00a0alienation in a new, unfamiliar environment.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director John Crowley takes the audience through the complexities of each character and lets the actors in the film shine. Every performance is full of emotion and evokes a sense of nostalgia. Ronan, Irish-born herself, delivers a stunning performance that quickly captures the heart of the audience. Ronan\u2019s character Lacey begins her journey as someone shy and inexperienced in the real world, and we see her grow into her true self throughout the movie. However, this inner transformation is subtle, for Ronan\u2019s character is not a fearless, larger than life heroine, but instead a very real woman struggling to find her place in the world. With\u00a0quiet strength and determination, Ronan is able to captivate the audience and bring the story of Ellis Lacey to life. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The costumes are\u00a0very well selected and do an exemplary job of enhancing the setting of the era. In particular,\u00a0in the scene at Coney Island, Lacey and Tom both wear\u00a0baggy, bright colored swimsuits authentic to the time period.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although \u201cBrooklyn\u201d has a large number of outstanding elements, the character development is generally lacking in the supporting cast. There is little insight into the life of the other characters in the story. Even with the sincerity and kindness of \u00a0Cohen\u2019s character, he remains largely two-dimensional despite being the main love interest. This is primarily\u00a0due to Crowley\u2019s intentions to illustrate small moments in the main character's life. However, there is\u00a0little to no insight into\u00a0the other characters in the story, although it clearly builds the potential for further development.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cBrooklyn\u201d feels like the result of a grandchild\u2019s inquiry into her ancestors. As a drama, it\u00a0paints a gritty and touching look into one young woman\u2019s journey. The film is not afraid to illustrate the loneliness\u00a0of an immigrant alone in a new country, but\u00a0does so in an intimate and refreshing manner.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBrooklyn\u201d is up for three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actress. Ronan\u2019s outstanding performance as Lacey arguably deserves Best Actress and the film has a good shot at Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u201cBrooklyn\u201d<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 hour, 51 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated: PG-13 for a scene of sexuality and brief strong language<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by John Crowley<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Starring: Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen<\/strong>","excerpt":"A touching immigrant story that transports audiences into 1950s New York, \u201cBrooklyn\u201d is a romantic drama, filled with rich history and full of emotion, and deserves its Oscar Nominations of Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actress.
