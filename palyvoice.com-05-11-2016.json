While administrators at both Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School have spoken in favor of adopting Supt. Max McGee\u2019s proposed district-wide policy of reporting unweighted GPAs only, many students and parents have vehemently argued against it, on the grounds that such a policy disadvantages students for certain merit scholarships and represents an infringement on student freedom.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tuesday night, the Board of Education <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/02\/board-votes-for-weighted-on-mid-year-transcripts-for-class-of-2017\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">passed a motion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to change the GPA reporting practice for the Class of 2017 at both Paly and Gunn - seniors who are currently in the midst of the college application process. For the mid-year report that will be sent to colleges, both the unweighted and weighted GPAs will be recorded on transcripts.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first glance, this may seem like a simple solution; reporting weighted GPAs eliminates any risk, however infinitesimal it may be, of a student being disadvantaged for scholarships. Additionally, weighted GPAs will emphasize the AP and honor classes that students take and supposedly give them the appropriate credit for challenging coursework. But what is ostensibly a straightforward solution will in reality open up a Pandora\u2019s box of other issues, and we urge community members to critically consider the long term repercussions.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Considering the consequences<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin, the practice of reporting weighted GPAs will almost certainly reinforce the excessively competitive academic culture that has become associated with Palo Alto. Weighting GPAs will encourage people to take AP- and honors-heavy course loads, at the expense of regular lane and\/or elective classes. Furthermore, since Paly and Gunn offer far more weighted STEM classes than humanities and social science classes, the practice of reporting weighted GPAs in effect diminishes the value of non-STEM courses. And alarmingly, reporting weighted GPAs is just a step away from ranking students, either formally or in a de facto manner, because weighted GPAs make it far easier to delineate between students\u2019 GPAs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The programs that board members have touted as examples of educational innovation, such as Advanced Authentic Research, the Social Justice Pathway and the journalism program, as well as performing and visual arts classes, will likely see declining enrollment as a result of the GPA decision. When forced to compete with peers and choose between programs that will add to their overall high school experience or boost their GPA, many will choose the latter.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the recording of weighted GPAs on transcripts could exacerbate another dogged problem in our district: the achievement gap. Only relatively wealthy students will be able to afford the outside tutoring for honors and AP courses, or off-campus instruction that allows them to accumulate more weighted credit, creating an even larger chasm between the privileged and the underserved in our community.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concern about the practice of weighting GPAs harming our most vulnerable students isn\u2019t a hypothetical one; it is very much grounded in anecdotal evidence. Because most weighted GPA methodologies do not take into account classes such as Living Skills and Physical Education, students who have earned high grades in those courses but have struggled in academic core classes may have lower weighted GPAs than unweighted GPAs. At the board meeting on Tuesday night, Paly Principal Kim Diorio reported that the administration has identified approximately 50 Paly students for whom this is the case. These students are disproportionately ethnic minorities, come from low-income families and have Individualized Education Programs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weighted GPAs also present a whole host of logistical issues and unnecessary confusion. For the updated reports that will be sent out to all schools students have applied to early, in addition to the mid-year reports that will be sent out for the Class of 2017, Paly will adopt the UC\/CSU methodology to calculate students' GPAs, while Gunn will be sticking with the algorithm it has been using for the past several years. Though board members claimed they prioritized standardizing practices between the two schools, their proposal doesn\u2019t even address the problem: there is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a disparity between Paly and Gunn. And if the schools were to continue weighting students\u2019 grades, what weighting methodology would they employ? Would they use the UC system, which doesn\u2019t consider many underclassmen honors classes for weighted credit and caps students to a maximum of eight semesters of weighted courses? Or would they devise another methodology, that would ultimately be arbitrary because colleges recalculate GPAs on their own? This is just a small sampling of the never-ending stream of questions that would arise.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Dispelling fictions<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though we are concerned about the effects of this decision on our school climate, we would like to emphasize that current seniors should not be concerned about the change in GPA reporting practices affecting their chances for college applications.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College admissions officers across the nation will unequivocally say that your transcript is considered within the context of your high school, and obviously, a Paly student\u2019s unweighted GPA is not being compared, from a purely numerical standpoint, with another applicant\u2019s weighted GPA. At the most recent school board meeting, proponents of weighted GPAs presented evidence that seemed to show that students with weighted GPAs receive a boost in college admissions. But those sources are misleading, because information was selectively cherry-picked. And significantly, our college counseling professionals and various admissions officers have told us the complete opposite: they state that high schools' GPA reporting practices do not have bearing on students' chances for acceptance.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addresses to the school board, some people have mentioned the scholarship opportunities that students will be deprived of if the district does not report weighted GPAs. We strongly believe that the district should do everything in its capacity to help students procure financial aid. However, it is nonsensical to use merit scholarships as a justification for changing the GPA practice because administrators have yet to find a college that will not accept a letter vouching for a student's weighted GPA in place of it on a transcript. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of a Paly student missing the GPA cutoff for a merit scholarship at the University of Oregon because her unweighted GPA was reported, Kim Diorio contacted an admissions officer at Oregon and resolved the issue; the student is now eligible to receive the scholarship. According to Diorio, the admissions representative did not want Paly to change its GPA reporting policy for one student, and as such, Oregon has agreed to accept letters from Paly and Gunn administrators vouching for weighted GPAs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, many in the pro-weighted GPA camp have said that reporting unweighted GPAs de-incentivizes students from challenging themselves academically. But this cannot be true, because many people at Paly and in general have taken difficult class loads knowing full well that only their unweighted GPAs will be reported to colleges. What reporting weighted GPAs could do, however, is compel students who aren\u2019t prepared for or interested in the content of AP classes to take them, and further contribute to a hyper-competitive academic atmosphere.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Moving forward<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The choice to report weighted GPAs is a drastic one, and likely irrevocable; we believe it will be near impossible to revert to the old system if the district elects to formally adopt reporting weighted GPAs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most appalling part about this decision is that students and parents were assured in writing that nothing would change for this college admissions cycle, and the school board, in unanimously voting to put weighted GPAs on our transcripts, has completely walked back on that promise. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A letter sent out to parents by the Parent Teacher Student Association on Oct. 13 stated, \u201cAs parents, we ask that you please share with your teen that for this school year, nothing will change. Anything about the issue will not affect the Class of 2017.\u201d Supt. McGee expressed similar sentiments in his weekly message published on Oct. 28, stating \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this year we are not recommending changing the current practices for grade reporting at either Gunn or Paly.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suffice to say, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">w<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e are deeply disappointed with the board members \u2014 who have run on platforms of promoting student wellbeing \u2014 for ignoring the recommendations of professional educators and proceeding with a motion that has the potential to increase stress among the student body. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The extremely abrupt school board decision also failed to follow previously established norms of evaluating both sides of the issue prior to making tangible changes. In the past, PAUSD has spent months forming committees, fostering discussion and reviewing board reports when making a decision affecting students. It is shocking that the board did not follow the same procedure in considering the GPA issue \u2014 what should have been a thoughtful and comprehensive evidence-gathering process became a rushed political maneuver to satiate the demands of an aggressive lobby.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while this hasty short-term proposal has been agreed on for this year's senior class, it is not too late for the district to reevaluate this decision and thoroughly examine the consequences that this will have on the culture of Palo Alto high schools for years to come.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve worked so hard, for so long, to fundamentally address the issue of student stress across Palo Alto schools. We take great pride in our community but far too many of us have felt the effects of a suffocatingly competitive environment\u00a0that overemphasizes academic achievement and contributes to a reduced sense of self-worth.\u00a0The practice of r<\/span>eporting weighted GPAs\u00a0is a multifaceted issue that has the potential to affect our school culture \u2014 and it certainly deserves\u00a0more than the cursory consideration it received.\r\n\r\n<i>Editor's Note: To avoid a conflict of interest with his involvement in this issue, The Paly Voice's adviser disengaged himself from the writing of this editorial.

Only the top team from the El Camino League gets to compete in the championship tournament, which is\u00a0predominantly reserved for the De Anza League.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vikings played in the De Anza League last year before Coach Andy Harader dropped the team down. Buoyed by young talent and solid leadership, the team has enjoyed a breakout season, according to Harader. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to senior doubles player, Avery Pearson, the Vikings won with perseverance. Pearson and her doubles partner, senior Alice Zhang, clinched\u00a0the deciding match in a game that went to the third set. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLos Altos is a tough team and a lot of the matches went into a third set,\" Pearson said.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior captain Meredith Cummings acknowledged some weakness in today\u2019s game.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Today was a tough match,\u201d Cummings said. \"We played well at the baseline overall, but on my court and the others that I could see, our volleys were mainly going into the net.

When I graduated, I decided to put my interest of science together with my interest of teaching, and start a post-bachelor teaching program.\"\r\n\r\nVerekyen moved to the Bay Area from Arizona in search of a change, as well as a way to be closer to family. She currently enjoys working with her stepmother, AP Statistics teacher Misha Stempel, at Paly.\r\n\r\n\"It's awesome, but it's kind of crazy,\" Verekyen said. \"We [Verekyen and Stempel] drive in to work together and we wave to\u00a0each other in meetings. It's great!\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Stempel, it's great to see her stepdaughter at Paly because she is able to reconnect with her as well as reminisce about old times.\r\n\r\n\"It's just kind of cool because when she was younger and she and her sister would get out of school they would come to Paly and draw on the chalkboards,\" Stempel\u00a0said. \u00a0\"I still have those pictures they drew for me back then so having\u00a0 her here now is really cool. It's fun catching up with her and being a part of her life.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Verekyen, she appreciates\u00a0the environment at Paly\u00a0and enjoys interacting with the students.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's awesome, there is so much support here and so many great things going on on campus that I didn't see at my other schools,\u201d Verekyen said.\r\n\r\nVerekyen\u00a0believes that biology is an important class to take in high school.\r\n\r\n\"I love teaching freshman biology because I think it sets a really good foundation for what students are going to need later on in high school and in college\" Verekyen said.\r\n\r\nOther than teaching,\u00a0Verekyen enjoys traveling and advises her students to consider studying abroad when in college.\r\n\r\n\"It really gives unique perspective and helps you to see how your major connects to the world in a more authentic way,\" Verkeyen said.\r\n\r\nTo students planning on pursuing biology, Verekyen\u00a0encourages curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy advice for students that pursue biology is to find a topic that you really love and start exploring it, see how you can use that passion to solve modern day challenges or help people,\" Verekyen said. \"And question everything. Ask a lot of questions. Question it all.\"","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with Palo Alto High School Biology teacher Tara Verekyen, and discussed her interests and her journey to becoming a teacher over a medium iced coffee.","date":"2016-10-29 12:06:55","author":"Daniella Maydan","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Tara-Verekyen.jpg","categories":["Coffee chats","Features","Spotlight"],"tags":["anthropology","biology","coffee chat","freshman","freshman biology","misha stempel","new teacher","tara verekyen","Teacher"]},{"id":125001,"title":"Groundbreaking Homecoming dance is groundbreakingly average","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/28\/groundbreaking-homecoming-dance-is-groundbreakingly-average\/","content":"Palo Alto Homecoming traditions continue to be formed and broken: After a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/15\/asb-breaks-tradition-with-new-homecoming-plans\/\">historical<\/a>\u00a0dance last year, the Paly\u00a0Associated Student Body and Gunn Student Executive Council hosted the first-ever joint\u00a0Homecoming dance last Saturday. Despite the exciting intermingling between Paly and Gunn students, this year\u2019s dance was also plagued with lengthy lines, minimal food and general confusion.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dance took place in two gyms at Henry M. Gunn High School, and students were free to walk from one building to another to dance or play games such as ping pong or foosball with friends. While the buildings provided ample space, the hallway between the two had a bottleneck effect due to its small width and the large number of students constantly passing through.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real trouble, however, began outside the front door. Several lines of roughly 2,100 students wound their way down to the parking lot, blocking cars. Many students were confused\u00a0as to which\u00a0line they had to stand in, and the process took over an hour for some. According to Paly Assistant Principal Kathleen Laurence, ticket takers aimed to spend five seconds admitting each student into the dance.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe actually finished getting kids in seven minutes faster than we thought possible,\u201d Laurence said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125027\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"438\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMAG0068.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-125027\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMAG0068.jpg\" alt=\"IMAG0068\" width=\"438\" height=\"281\" \/><\/a> Students stand in a line stretching from the gym entrance into the parking lot to enter the dance. \"Waiting in line for nearly an hour ended up taking up a significant portion of the dance itself,\" senior Alix Westgaard said. Photo: Aidan Maese-Czeropski.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While long waits are understandable, administration breathalyzed every single student, which was a waste of time. An alternative would be to\u00a0breathalyze\u00a0one in five or one in 10\u00a0students, saving time and still preventing underage drinking. Furthermore, the lack of signs made it so many people were unaware if they were in line to purchase tickets or enter the dance, and administration did little to prevent students from cutting in line. Some students spent over one third of their allotted time standing in line, yet the dance was not extended.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I finally entered the gymnasium one hour after I arrived, I was eager to eat. Unfortunately, nearly all the food had been consumed\u00a0by the time I arrived, save for a bowl of colorful chips and salsa. Attendants occasionally brought out stacks of cookies or chocolate covered strawberries, and while they were delicious, they rarely lasted long. With thousands of students attending the dance,\u00a0ASB and SEC\u00a0should have expected the food to be quickly devoured and prepared accordingly.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The long lines and minimal food were partially compensated by enjoyable music and dancing: the most anticipated part of Homecoming was, as always, the dance floor. The DJ accepted student song requests and played a large variety of genres that were generally danceable. Iridescent lights and images of stars flashed across the walls, and most students were receptive to the music. Reconnecting with friends from other schools and meeting new people was both easy and encouraged, on and off the dance floor.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dance featured entertaining games, including ping pong and foosball, as well as photo booths and a caricature artist. However, these areas remained extremely crowded. Increasing the number of ping pong tables from the two present would have allowed more people to take part in the fun. Special effects such as lights and banners outside the dance room were also minimal. This itself was fine, as streamers don\u2019t necessarily entertain; however,\u00a0students were promised extra amenities in exchange for an inexpensive venue\u00a0so\u00a0the rooms felt almost bare.<\/span>\r\n\r\nPaly senior Alix Westgaard\u00a0says that while Homecoming was an enjoyable experience, it could have been planned much better.\r\n\r\n\"I think the challenge of having so many people attending the same venue needed to be addressed,\" Westgaard said. \"There wasn't enough space for all the cars picking up students and there weren't enough entrances to the dance, causing a very long line. In the future, they could\u00a0try to stagger the homecomings so they occurred on different weekends or try to find a different location for Paly's homecoming. Leaving the parking lot after the dance also took forty-five minutes.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homecoming 2016 wasn\u2019t entirely \"bad.\" But when sprinting to the food table to grab a snickerdoodle or two before they run out is one of the dance\u2019s high points, you know the night didn\u2019t live up to its potential.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"Despite the exciting intermingling between Paly and Gunn students, this year\u2019s Homecoming dance was plagued with lengthy lines, minimal food and general confusion.","date":"2016-10-28 20:57:57","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMAG0068.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","ASB","dance","groundbreaking","gunn","homecoming","joint","palo alto","paly","sec"]}]
