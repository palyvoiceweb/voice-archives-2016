According to head coach Don Briggs, this allowed him to change the lineup later in the game, when Paly was leading 3-0.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were able to possess the ball when we needed to,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cTen minutes into the second half, we started putting people in different positions. Doing that is actually good for them because it gives them the chance to work on different things.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings took advantage of their offensive opportunities much better than in previous matches, with goals by senior midfielder Cole Tierney, senior defender Cam Huard, senior forward Max Hallberg, senior midfielder Dami Bolarinwa and senior forward Ariya Momeny.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe got five goals and we capitalized on most of our opportunities, which is an improvement from our other games,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cI definitely have more confidence now and I think a lot of people do because there was a wealth of goals. That\u2019s always good to build confidence and have confidence in other people too.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Mountain View head coach Jim Mcguirk, the Spartans struggled to adjust their defensive strategy against Paly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDefensively, we\u2019ve played pretty good all year, but we didn\u2019t play as good today,\u201d Mcguirk said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t adjust to how fast they were. There were things we could\u2019ve done, like changed positioning to be in the right spots. We were in the spots that we\u2019re in against other teams, but we didn\u2019t adjust to their speed and get into different positions where we could handle their speed better.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings worked together more effectively in this game than they had in previous weeks, according to Bolarinwa.\r\n\r\n\"We moved the ball, got open, found the time to pass and hold the ball,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cIt was really good to see how our team is finally clicking together.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly will play Fremont High School (2-4-3, 1-1-1) at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday at Fremont.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' soccer team (8-0-1, 4-0) dominated the Mountain View High School Spartans (5-2-4, 0-1-1) on Friday at the Paly soccer field by a score of 5-0.","date":"2016-01-18 22:38:20","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_7965.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap"],"tags":["ariya momeny","boys soccer","cam huard","cole tierney","dami bolarinwa","don briggs","jim mcguirk","max hallberg","mountain view","palo alto high school","roberto sotelo","Soccer","spartans","vikings"]},{"id":114478,"title":"Advisory this week is for all sophomores and select freshmen (A-K)","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/17\/advisory-this-week-is-for-all-sophomores-and-select-freshmen-a-k\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-17 23:33:14","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":114273,"title":"Palo Alto teen center to celebrate grand opening","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/16\/palo-alto-teen-center-to-celebrate-grand-opening\/","content":"The Mitchell Park Community Center will host food, games\u00a0and a DJ in honor of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Mitchell-Park-Teen-Center\/475685722572832\">Fridays at the Drop's grand opening<\/a> next Friday.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Drop,\u201d a teen center specially designed for high school students in Palo Alto, is a drop-in space for those looking to relax, hang out with friends or play sports and video games, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityofpaloalto.org\/gov\/depts\/csd\/recreation\/teens\/drop.asp\">City of Palo Alto website<\/a>.

According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skypossepaloalto.org\">Sky Posse\u2019s website<\/a>, changes by the Federal Aviation Administration have led to increased air traffic over Palo Alto neighborhoods, and many residents claim this lowers the city's standard of living and causes unneeded distractions.\r\n\r\nThe\u00a0meeting included information regarding Sky Posse\u2019s website, methods for reporting airplanes as well as general information and an update from the City of Palo Alto.

Although traffic at nearby airports in San Jose and San Francisco is growing, this newfound noise mainly results from the new Next Generation Air Transportation System, which shortens flight distances and times and saves fuel while simultaneously increasing flights over urban areas.\r\n\r\nSince NextGen\u2019s implementation, complaints against airplane noise from Palo Altans has mushroomed. Wednesday\u00a0night\u2019s meeting represented the culmination of months of research and lobbying for reduced sound, according to Landesmann.\r\n\r\nWhile Sky Posse mainly aims to address noise pollution, the organization also points out potential health risks associated with numerous low-flying aircrafts. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/news.nationalgeographic.com\/news\/2010\/10\/101005-planes-pollution-deaths-science-environment\/\">National Geographic<\/a>, plane emissions cause 10,000 deaths in the world each year. Landesmann says that the benefits of shifted flight routes outweighs the loss of jet fuel that could be saved by simply flying straight over the Bay Area.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_114304\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"336\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/12473653_10203895766273423_6465419346657067747_o1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-114304\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/12473653_10203895766273423_6465419346657067747_o1.jpg\" alt=\"12473653_10203895766273423_6465419346657067747_o\" width=\"336\" height=\"367\" \/><\/a> Sky Posse co-leader Rachel Kellerman poses with a board mapping airplane noise complaints in the Peninsula. \"Nothing will change ...

Kellerman says she hopes to work with both Palo Alto and the FAA to cause faster results.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe longer this program [NextGen] goes on, the harder it is to stop,\u201d Kellerman said.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, Sky Posse aims to shift flight routes away from Bay Area towns as much as possible, not just Palo Alto, according to Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to have a redesign of our airspace,\u201d Kellerman said.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Sky Posse will continue to petition the local government to take action and may attend City Council meetings in the future, according to Landesmann\r\n\r\n\u201cOur city is going to have to fight really hard,\u201d Landesmann said.","excerpt":"Palo Alto residents are taking to the City of Palo Alto to protest loud and low-flying airplanes after a \u201cSky Posse\u201d meeting Wednesday night at the Lucie Stern Community Center.","date":"2016-01-15 16:34:58","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/12473653_10203895766273423_6465419346657067747_o1.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["airplane noise","community center","faa","jennifer landesmann","lucie stern","nextgen","palo alto","palo alto high school","paly","quiet skies","rachel kellerman","sky posse","transportation"]},{"id":114247,"title":"Boys&#8217; soccer takes down Gunn","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/15\/boys-soccer-takes-down-gunn\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_114249\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"607\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_7689.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-114249\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_7689.jpg\" alt=\"Junior midfielder Jack Stoksik overcomes his defender in the first half of the match against the Vikings' cross town rivals, the Gunn Titans.

The red card, given to junior center defender Neil Verwillow, also resulted in a free kick play right outside of the goal box. The free kick resulted in Gunn\u2019s only goal, allowing them to get back into the game, down by one goal with a score of 2-1 with 25 minutes left in the second half.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe got that red card and then they scored a goal,\u201d head coach Don Briggs said. \u201cIt felt like \u2018Oh my gosh, we\u2019re in a dog fight now, 2-1.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings were able to come into the game with a lot of energy, according to junior forward Michel Ange Siaba.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe came on the field very pumped because, you know, this is Gunn,\u201d Siaba said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate game. The energy was really high up, which is probably our greatest strength right now: coming onto the field with energy and challenging the opponent.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter a roughly even first half, the Vikings led 1-0 on a goal scored by senior midfielder Dami Bolarinwa, finished off of a slowed breakaway by senior forward Alessandro Reale. Despite leading in score, both teams struggled with keeping possession during the first half.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat first half was a little sketchy,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the kids were a little bit nervous, but it seemed like they were holding onto the ball and waiting for the perfect pass, and then they\u2019d make a bad pass. We make three or four or five good passes and then we make one bad pass and give it up, and we\u2019re back on our heels again.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Gunn head coach Ken Luis, facing Paly was a challenge, but the Titans performed well.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of the players were really up for the Palo Alto rivalry,\u201d Luis said. \u201cThis is always a big game. I could tell that, this week, the guys were really excited for this game. We had our moments, but it was overall probably one of our better games this season.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly\u2019s third and final goal, scored on a free kick by senior midfielder Roberto Sotelo to Bolarinwa and finished by senior forward Max Hallberg, shifted the game\u2019s momentum back into Paly\u2019s favor, helping the team to finish on a strong note, according to Briggs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe scored the next goal and it kind of ended that feeling [of panic],\u201d Briggs said.\r\n\r\nDespite being able to finish on multiple chances, including an early goal in the second half by Siaba, Paly struggled with finishing their offensive chances, according to Briggs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had so many opportunities we just need to put the ball in the net when we have those crosses,\u201d Briggs said.\r\n\r\nPaly will face off against the Mountain View Spartans (5-1-4, 0-0-1) at 3:30 p.m. on Friday at the Vikings\u2019 field.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 soccer team (7-0-1, 3-0) took down its cross-town rival, Gunn High School (0-0-8, 0-2), 3-1 on Wednesday at Gunn.","date":"2016-01-15 14:20:11","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_7813.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap","Spotlight"],"tags":["bolarinwa","briggs","gunn high school","hallberg","ken luis","palo alto high school","reale","siaba","Soccer","stoksik","titans","verwillow","vikings"]}]
