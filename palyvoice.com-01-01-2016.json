Hopefully it will be anonymous when the feedback is released. I didn\u2019t want the students to say something and then get tracked down for it, so I was worried for them.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, the student ID login is to prevent a single user from filling out multiple surveys.\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t and teachers won\u2019t have access to who said what,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIt\u2019s more used on the back end with IT [Information Technology] and the software company that it\u2019s run through. I think they were worried that without having some way for students to identify that it would invalidate some of the results. They wanted to make sure that it was a single sign-on.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe survey was generally well-received by students, as it gave them a chance to say what might not otherwise be said, according to sophomore Tanay Krishna.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe survey is useful because it gives students an opportunity to directly critique things that they think are going well and things that are not going well in their classes,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cIf students don\u2019t feel comfortable telling their teachers something, it gives them a way to say what could be improved in their classes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe survey consists of 12 questions and is administered in all classes, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s 10 questions that are all on the likert scale, so strongly disagree to strongly agree,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cThen, there are two open-ended questions. The questions were negotiated between the district and the Palo Alto Education Association, PAEA, last spring as part of the collective bargaining that takes place every year with the annual teacher\u2019s contract.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to science teacher Ashwini Avadhani, the survey is an effective way to give feedback to teachers, which is important for improving\u00a0learning environments.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe questions are fair and I think that students should have their opinions and should have a right to give a teacher feedback,\u201d Avadhani said. \u201cTeachers also need to get feedback. They need to know what they\u2019re doing right and what they\u2019re doing wrong.\u201d","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District has issued a new district-wide student input survey to collect data and give students a chance to provide feedback for their teachers and courses.","date":"2015-12-17 20:11:24","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/DSC_0006.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["avadhani","diorio","paea","palo alto high school","paly","PAUSD","student","survey","Vuong"]},{"id":113666,"title":"Robotics Team fighting to win competition tomorrow","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/16\/robotics-team-fighting-to-win-competition-tomorrow\/","content":"Palo Alto High School\u2019s Zero Robotics Team is in first place among\u00a0the semifinalist bracket\u00a0of\u00a0the 2015 Zero Robotics High School Tournament and has\u00a0a chance of\u00a0becoming a finalist if they keep their position after\u00a0tomorrow's game.\r\n\r\nIf the Vikings compete successfully against other groups tomorrow, the team will keep its first place title\u00a0in\u00a0the \"losing\" bracket and advance\u00a0to compete in the finalist round. The teams are competing for a chance to operate their code on a robot in the International Space Station, according to robotics\u00a0head coach Christopher Kuszmaul.\r\n\r\nIn the contest, robots compete with each other in a series of one-on-one online simulations, Kuszmaul said.

Zero Robotics is unique in that its robots are controlled by programming; during competitions, the robots run autonomously by code.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Zero Robotics team, with\u00a0approximately\u00a0eighty students, started this year as a subdepartment of the school\u2019s larger Robotics Team.

He teaches U.S. Government and Contemporary World History for 10th grade, as well as Foreign Policy, an elective for upperclassmen.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yonkers grew up in Washington, D.C., and majored in marketing communications and public relations at Colorado College. According to Yonkers, he pursued those majors along with law until his early 30s when he realized it wasn\u2019t what he wanted to do in life. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was really unhappy because I didn\u2019t like the nature of the work,\u201d Yonkers said. \u201cI kept on going to bed reading these big history books and I was like, 'I want to coach and do something I\u2019m more interested in.'\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After this realization, Yonkers applied to Stanford for a masters program while working\u00a0across the street at Paly. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Yonkers, the transition from business to teaching was somewhat smooth because of his past employment experiences. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor my marketing communications background, I was writing publications and internal memos for businesses,\u201d Yonkers said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do all day long [now]; read students' work and the news, and try to synthesize that information and then try to teach it.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Yonkers was surprised by how different teaching was from an office job. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other parts of teaching that I was not prepared for,\" Yonkers said. \"I mean, I don't think you can be prepared for it until you teach. The cool part is this, you guys [students], the human factor. But the hard part is all the preparation and the grading and then the performance.\u201d\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Yonkers, Paly has positively changed since he arrived 10 years ago. When he first began teaching, Paly started at 7:50 a.m. and there were only\u00a0two block days a week. Since then, Paly implemented four block days that start 25 minutes later and eliminated the zero period. Yonkers says that this and other new administrative policies have helped to improve students' mental health.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that there are a lot more outlets for kids that are in trouble and the mental awareness are available and that administration is a lot more open to that dialogue, so I think it's better,\u201d Yonkers said. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also said that most issues students currently face are associated with the competitive environment. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou're a talented group of teenagers and you don't realize that you're in an actually really good position,\u201d Yonkers said. \u201cOnce you're out of Palo Alto, you'll realize that you're totally well prepared. But it's hard not to get caught up in getting compared to others within Palo Alto.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nOne of Yonkers' favorite parts of teaching\u00a0is when former students visit after high school and have gained a whole new perspective on their lives because of new experiences.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can have people tell you it's this way and that way,\" Yonkers said. \"But you won't know exactly until you really go through it and go out into the world and start to see that you'll be well prepared,\" Yonkers said.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with history teacher Adam Yonkers over a cup of Americano coffee to discuss the impact of switching careers and his experience teaching at Palo Alto High School for 10 years.","date":"2015-12-15 11:23:28","author":"Aisha Chabane","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-11.07.58-AM.png","categories":["Coffee chats"],"tags":["10th grade","coffee","coffee chat","foreign policy","history","Teacher","Yonkers"]},{"id":113453,"title":"Art classes present glass purple hearts to veterans","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/15\/art-classes-present-glass-purple-hearts-to-veterans\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_113469\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"237\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12387870_455010471350196_1082091635_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-113469\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12387870_455010471350196_1082091635_n.jpg\" alt=\"Senior [[[[do you know who the senior is?]]]]... writes and signs a card that will be presented with the artwork.

Purple Hearts are often given as a military decoration to veterans who have been wounded or killed while serving the country. The students are also gift wrapping the art pieces and making cards to deliver to the Palo Alto Veterans Administration.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThis is the first year the art department has worked with the Purple Heart idea, but art teachers\u00a0have collaborated on other projects with organizations such as the Traumatic Brain Injury Center during the Halloween season in the past. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he students learned how to make glass paperweights and beads in class, and decided to use\u00a0their new skills to give to veteran patients that are away from friends and families over holidays, Ferrera said, adding, \"I<\/span>t's just a little gesture to lift everyone's spirits.\"\r\n\r\nJunior Cassandra Fong, a ceramics student, said she appreciates the ability to learn new skills while simultaneously giving to the community.\r\n\r\n\"I love the opportunity to use our glass blowing equipment to make Purple Hearts to show our appreciation for our veterans,\" Fong said.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project shows\u00a0students that art is\u00a0important and useful in many ways, including helping to improve the common good, according to Ferrera.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou always hear kids and other people asking\u00a0what art is good for, and this puts that question into perspective,\u201d Ferrera said.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School\u2019s intermediate ceramic classes are giving handblown glass jewelry and paperweights to Palo Alto veterans during finals week.

The tradition of giving first-year varsity players especially notable haircuts is regarded by some as hazing, but by others as a fun team-bonding exercise.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to senior goalkeeper Eli Friedlander, the tradition of giving team haircuts originated from the team's former preseason schedule full of Catholic private schools.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe idea is that we would have crazy haircuts to play them,\u201d Friedlander said. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creative measures are taken by the haircut givers, usually upperclassmen on the team, according to junior outside defender Neil Verwillow. First-year varsity players are given especially memorable\u00a0haircuts, though no one is forced to get a haircut.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis year, some people tried to replicate professional players\u2019 haircuts such as Marco Reus,\u201d Verwillow said. \u201cI knew that if it was your first year playing varsity, a really bad haircut was given. No one is forced to get a bad one, and even if they [choose to get a haircut], they could stop and walk away at any point for any reason.\u201d\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Verwillow, the experience was positive and uniting for the team.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt's a very positive team building activity,\u201d Verwillow said. \u201cIt's fun to receive one [a haircut], and you can show it off as a token of making the varsity squad.

Photo by Dhara Yu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In \u201cThe Displaced,\u201d which chronicles the lives of three refugee children, viewers meet Oleg, a Ukrainian boy whose village has been reduced to rubble; Chuol, who has fled with his grandmother in order to escape the strife in South Sudan; and Hana, a Syrian refugee seeking asylum across the border in Lebanon. \u201cVigils in Paris\u201d captures the mourning in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. And in the most recent feature film, \u201cTake Flight,\u201d you float above a city skyline, coming face to face with the year's most noteworthy actors while suspended in the clouds.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While apps compatible with Cardboard are already available on Google Play and the App Store, most of these involve video gaming. The NYTVR app,\u00a0on the other hand,\u00a0is marketed as a kind of journalistic supplement<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In reality, there\u00a0is not that much content on the app (each feature film is\u00a0less than 12 minutes long),\u00a0but I thought it was worth downloading just to get a taste of the virtual reality experience.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though it is certainly not the first large-scale foray into this kind of technology, the Times\u2019 VR experiment is unique because of its accessibility \u2014 all that\u2019s required is a smartphone, and if desired, an inexpensive cardboard apparatus. <\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Google Cardboard itself looks like a boxy pair of binoculars. To use it, you simply insert your phone in the front flap of the Cardboard and peer through the plastic convex lenses. You can actually watch content from the NYTVR without Cardboard, but naturally, it\u2019s a lot more immersive with the eyepiece.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_113524\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"402\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_2642.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-113524\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_2642.png\" alt=\"A screenshot from &quot;The Displaced,&quot; the NYTVR feature film that follows the lives of three refugee children. Photo by Dhara Yu.\" width=\"402\" height=\"226\" \/><\/a> A screenshot from \"The Displaced,\" the NYTVR feature film that follows the lives of three refugee children. Photo by Dhara Yu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe experience is truly remarkable. You hear the refugee children give harrowing testimonies of struggle and loss \u2014 yet manage to find fleeting moments of happiness \u2014 as you look around and survey the desolate landscape. The emotion is palpable when you witness the somber gatherings at the scenes of the attacks. And there is something exhilarating (albeit maybe a bit nauseating) about drifting away into the sky.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the app does have some technological issues. For the Cardboard viewing setting, the stereoscopic effect is somewhat finicky, so you end up having double vision if your screen isn\u2019t perfectly aligned with the eyepiece. Also, the screen quality is disappointingly low, so the films appear somewhat grainy and pixelated. It's marginally better in non-Cardboard mode.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, at least, virtual reality technology for the masses remains in an inchoate stage, and practically speaking, NYTVR is more of a novelty than a journalism staple. But there\u2019s something enticing, even transcendent, about the notion of experiencing life through an entirely different lens \u2014 and that is the value in the app.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"In another installment of The Paly Voice's APPetite blog, Opinion Editor Dhara Yu reviews NYTVR, the New York Times app that aims to transform the journalistic experience as well as make virtual reality technology more accessible.
