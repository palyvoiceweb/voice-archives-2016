Each theme corresponds with each class\u2019 color: orange for freshmen, red for sophomores, yellow for juniors and green for seniors.\r\n\r\nThis year, the freshman theme is \u201cEye of the Tiger,\u201d the sophomore theme is \u201cFirefighters,\u201d the junior theme is \u201cBoxing\u201d and the senior theme is \u201cGame Over.\u201d Rather than wearing clothes that correspond to their theme, due to Paly tradition, seniors instead wear 90s apparel on Monday.\r\n\r\nThis year, Spirit Week festivities open at lunch on the football field with the lunchtime rally, which will feature three main events: Knee Trembler, Banana Bump and Pass the Water.\r\n\r\nKnee Trembler, a new event to Paly Spirit Week, is a mini relay race consisting of three students from each grade. Using only their knees, students must pick up an orange and hop over to a hula hoop placed on the ground. Whoever has placed the most oranges in the hoop at the end of a minute will win.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Knee Trembler game, the Banana Bump event will take place. This time, only one student from each grade will participate. The student will have a banana tied around his or her waist and must bump an orange, using the banana, past the finish line.\r\n\r\n\"The other new game is Pass the Water,\" ASB Spirit Commissioner Michaela Fogarty said. \"Participants line up and transfer water from one bucket to another by passing it to each other over their heads with cups. The grade with the most water in the final bucket wins.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Fogarty, the results of the events are unpredictable.\r\n\r\n\"None of the grades are projected to win any of the games,\" Fogarty said. \"It should be very competitive and exciting to watch.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the points awarded for the events, class cheers and scores for best dressed will award each grade with extra points. Cheers at each rally can earn up to 800 points for first place and up to 500 points for the best dressed contest.\r\n\r\nUp to 150 points of deductions are possible for sportsmanship and cleanliness.\r\n\r\nFor more information on lunchtime rallies and the Spirit Week scoring system, refer to the <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/pahsasb\/sw2016\" target=\"_blank\">ASB master schedule<\/a>.

The full discussion agenda can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boarddocs.com\/ca\/pausd\/Board.nsf\/goto?open=&amp;id=AEETTD772CFC\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\nA number of Palo Alto parents and students\u00a0are pushing for the option of reporting weighted GPAs, and have sent numerous messages to Paly administration and the school board, according to Principal Kim Diorio.\r\n\r\nPTSA President Katie Shade sent an e-mail to Paly parents on Wednesday to inform them of Paly's\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1dgRurvVuzDXtwWqByW2LQgKYiFhHWuQ84r_lCxhSteY\/edit\">position statement<\/a>\u00a0in response to the message.\r\n\r\nPaly's position paper states that the administration and faculty \"feel strongly that when schools use weighted grades, a culture of competition and stress develops\" and stand against submitting weighted GPAs. Stating there should be no submitting of weighted GPAs for this years' graduating class, which has caused uproar from some parents and students\r\n\r\nIn a meeting with the Paly Associated Student Body, Diorio outlined her concerns with submitting weighted GPAs.\r\n\r\n\"By having an unweighted transcript, it draws focus away from student competition and will help reduce stress,\" Diorio said. \"[Gunn Principal] Dr. [Denise] Herrmann and I\u00a0have\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">big goals in redefining success and strengthening Gunn and Paly culture. We want to have a<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lternate pathways to success, where students are more than their GPA.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, for the past 35 years Paly has been exclusively reporting unweighted grades. Neither Gunn nor Paly report weighted grades on transcripts, and Gunn reports weighted grades within applications.\r\n\r\nGunn School Board Representative senior Ankit Ranjan says this difference between the schools' reporting methods has pushed students from both PAUSD high schools to voice their opinions on the matter at the upcoming board meeting.\r\n\r\n\"Gunn students can ask to have either their weighted or unweighted GPA reported [to colleges],\" Ranjan said. \"We're currently working with members of the Paly community with [Paly senior] Maya Katz in getting more students involved at Tuesday's\u00a0board meeting.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boarddocs.com\/ca\/pausd\/Board.nsf\/goto?open&amp;id=AEPV5U7F1FB4\">School Board agenda<\/a>, the primary argument in support of weighted grades to this point has revolved around scholarships for out of state public schools, particularly University of Oregon. Scholarship money is important, and according to counselors, is increasingly\u00a0more of a factor for students making decisions as to what institutions they will apply\u00a0to and\u00a0attend.\u00a0 The discussion around weighted grading arose from a conversation several months ago regarding the University of Oregon\u2019s practices for awarding merit scholarships.\u00a0 The University awards an automatic $36,000 Summit Scholarship for out of state students with a GPA of 3.8 or higher, and an automatic $16,000 Apex Scholarship for a GPA of 3.6 or higher.\u00a0 They do not recalculate GPAs and only use what is on the transcript.\r\n\r\nConcerns\u00a0raised by parent and students of the Paly community are primarily represented by Katz and her family. Katz has recently reached out to Paly and Gunn Student Executive Council (SEC) in bringing more student voice into the issue.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent meeting with Paly ASB, Katz articulated her position on the issue, stating the need for the submission of weighted GPAs for students seeking scholarships.\r\n\r\n\"I've come to ASB to get more students informed on the issue, and to make sure students are able to understand what is at stake,\" Katz said. \"By releasing only unweighted GPAs we become ineligible for merit-based scholarships for universities. Students with an unweighted GPA of 3.75, for example, and a weighted GPA of 4.0 will not be eligible for scholarships that require a 3.8. That's $36,000 or more just because of the report. I've spoken to the admissions staff for universities like University of Oregon and they blatantly said they would not accept this GPA for a\u00a0scholarship. If a weighted GPA were submitted, this wouldn't be the case.\"\r\n\r\nKatz says she wants\u00a0all students to have a say regardless of if they agree or disagree with her opinion, and is currently working with her family and a community of parents in doing research to better inform members of the Paly community\u00a0of the issue.\r\n\r\n\"There are a lot of parents involved in this, and it's important to be getting more students involved,\" Katz said.\u00a0\"It will affect them directly.\"\r\n\r\nKatz will be speaking at\u00a0the upcoming board meeting this Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMcGee recommends that the board not make any change for this years' graduating seniors (class of 2017), and then make a decision after community involvement. He has mentioned that he is predisposed to not offering a weighted grade option in order to limit our emphasis on honors and AP classes, but doesn't want to make a decision without consulting students, according to statements made by Ranjan, Diorio and Paly School Board Representative David Tayeri.\r\n\r\nAccording to McGee, the board meeting will not feature a vote on the issue that day, but will instead be a chance for an open discussion that could lead to a vote in the future.\r\n\r\n\"Please let everyone know that there is no action item\u00a0on the agenda for the 18th,\" McGee stated according to the email from Shade. \"[The meeting] is an information[al] discussion item that may or may not lead to action at a future date.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcGee is interested in receiving comprehensive student input, according to Tayeri. McGee has contacted Tayeri in providing an outlet for students to voice their concerns.\r\n\r\n\"Until a couple years ago, board members would buy pizza and invite students to discuss their views on issues,\" Tayeri said. \"They'd have time to talk to board members one-on-one. They haven't done this in a few years, but I think it would be a good idea to bring that back. There is enough student engagement that we would have a good turnout.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education will be discussing whether PAUSD High Schools' will be submitting weighted or unweighted grade point averages (GPAs) to colleges at 6:30 Tuesday Oct. 18. at the district office.","date":"2016-10-16 15:52:33","author":"Bianca Al-Shamari","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMG_0070.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["ASB","board meeting","college","diorio","gpa","grades","gunn","herrmann","high school","McGee","paly","sec","tayeri","transcipts","unweighted","weighted"]},{"id":124267,"title":"Vikings defeat Gunn to redeem themselves","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/16\/vikings-defeat-gunn-to-redeem-themselves\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_124368\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"602\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Celebration1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-124368\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Celebration1.jpg\" alt=\"The Vikings celebrate last night in the Gunn High School gym.

We are hosting this as a sort of community service,\" Beverine said. \"We're trying to help out those families that don't have insurance, or have a limited insurance plan. If someone is paying out of pocket, the price can be $50\u00a0or more for a physical. We're doing it for $10 and the money we raise\u00a0we send back to the high schools.\"\r\n\r\nJustine Iongi, the head athletic trainer for Paly is one of the many high school athletic trainers partnered with the program. Every trainer\u00a0has a direct line with the Stanford athletic trainers, giving them the ability to call Stanford when they are in need of their services at the press of a button.\r\n\r\n\"This\u00a0[program] unified us as a team to be better able to catch small things that we might have been unable to catch before,\" Iongi said. \"We can now send our athletes for more detailed screenings and get them the care they need faster. It's a quick process that will help a lot of people that either don't have insurance or just want an affordable resource for sports related injuries and information.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_124246\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"441\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_9477.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-124246\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_9477.jpg\" alt=\"Stanford Physicians hold one-on-one conferences with student athletes as a final assessment of their health for sports physicals.

However, besides these climate changes, the true quintessential signifier of autumn\u2019s beginning comes in the form of pumpkin spice. <\/span>\r\n\r\nBusinesses around the Bay Area, complying with the mass hype surrounding pumpkin spice, are busy producing ridiculous assortments of pumpkin drinks, snacks and desserts. Unlike themed holiday products, pumpkin spice is not in celebration of any particular event, but the excitement\u00a0 that seems to follow it seems to be worthy of its own form of holiday.\r\n\r\nPeet's Coffee and Tea has recently released a completely new menu with an assortment of pumpkin drinks. These include the Pumpkin Latte, the Pumpkin Chai, the Pumpkin Mocha, and the Pumpkin Javiva.\r\n\r\nIs this seasonal collection really equivalent to \u201cfall in a cup\u201d? Does pumpkin really go with everything, even chocolate? The Paly Voice decided to test out what this pumpkin spice craze was all about.\r\n\r\nBelow we<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> have picked three areas to judge: Aesthetic, Taste and finally Fall spirit.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16805121_3eaf1771b375b8abbf09622cf012db5473431e79.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-123898 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16805121_3eaf1771b375b8abbf09622cf012db5473431e79.jpeg\" alt=\"new-piktochart_16805121_3eaf1771b375b8abbf09622cf012db5473431e79\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We started off with the Pumpkin Latte ($3.75 for a small), a creamy coffee topped with a small peak of white foam. It looked like your average Peet's latte, with equally creamy blend of milk, and strong coffee but with slight hint of what could be inferred to be pumpkin\u00a0flavor. The reality was that it tasted like a strangely bitter sugar sweetener with maybe a hint of cinnamon. We were all quite unimpressed with the drinks unassuming appearance and lackluster taste. It was a decent latte, but a poor pumpkin drink.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16961221_bc47b73daafaf6251d89b8161e01a80b24da3a4c.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-123899 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16961221_bc47b73daafaf6251d89b8161e01a80b24da3a4c.jpeg\" alt=\"new-piktochart_16961221_bc47b73daafaf6251d89b8161e01a80b24da3a4c\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe Pumpkin Chai,\u00a0$4 for a small\u00a0comes in a solid white paper cup and is topped with equally bland and slightly droopy white cream. However, the aromatic scents of cinnamon, chai spices, and pumpkin wafting up from this drink were enough to leave our mouths watering. Taking a sip of this drink was like taking in fall in a mouthful. A wonderful warmth fills each sip, the thick taste of cinnamon creating the picture the warm fireplaces and changing leaves hued in a kaleidoscope of color. However, there was still a slight bitterness from the artificial pumpkin that accompanied the warm aftertaste of this drink that kept us from enjoying it fully.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16961404_06e42013541a35e79d2eb78eb0ff77db29a44603.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-123901 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16961404_06e42013541a35e79d2eb78eb0ff77db29a44603.jpeg\" alt=\"new-piktochart_16961404_06e42013541a35e79d2eb78eb0ff77db29a44603\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe Pumpkin Mocha $4 was an elegant ensemble of fluffy whipped cream topped with a colorful sprinkling of cinnamon and chocolate powder. It was by far the most creative presentation of the four new drinks on the fall menu. We were all quite skeptical of a pumpkin-chocolate combination, but the two flavors combined surprisingly well. The thick coffee accentuated the flavoring of dark chocolate and the small accents of pumpkin were pleasant and subtle, however, not overpowered by the coffee and chocolate flavoring. With fun presentation and the unusual flavor combination, it felt like the perfect drink to order as a festive fall treat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_172_d3b99e9882cac3ed669182be65c95f72fd230b60.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-123902 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_172_d3b99e9882cac3ed669182be65c95f72fd230b60.jpeg\" alt=\"new-piktochart_172_d3b99e9882cac3ed669182be65c95f72fd230b60\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pumpkin Javiva ($4 for a small), was a decadent swirling of toppling whipped cream served in a clear plastic cup revealing the drinks frothy caramel coloring. With each sip, you were overwhelmed by a fury of cinnamon, pumpkin and sugar. The taste was a perfect match for the desired seasonal flavoring, but after the third or fourth sip, the drink grew too sweet for our tastes. However, if in the mood for a Javiva, we consider this the perfect option. The pumpkin and cinnamon tones in this drink make it a great option for an autumn drink.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pumpkin Chai, with its rich cinnamon flavoring and comforting warmth, came out as a clear winner in terms of how authentically \u201cfall\u201d it was. However, in terms of taste and a fun presentation, we would recommend the Pumpkin Mocha, an unusual match of flavorings to spice up these increasingly chilly weeks. Overall, even if you are a more traditional coffee drinker, we still recommend giving these drinks a try. Although pumpkin spice did not totally live up to its legendary hype, these drinks are great for the occasional treat and a fun way to get into the autumn spirit. <\/span>","excerpt":"It's safe to say fall has truly begun.
