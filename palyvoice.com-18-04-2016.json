Each panel is designed to convey a different aspect of Paly, including \u201cWe are creative,\u201d \u201cWe have spirit,\u201d \u201cWe struggle\u201d and \u201cWe learn.\u201d\r\n\r\nArtists working on the mural hope that it will allow students to reflect on their own lives at Paly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe [the students] wanted to create a mural that embodies the entire spirit of Paly,\u201d says junior Grace Zhao, who d<span class=\"_5yl5\">esigned the Spirit Week scene in the bottom left corner<\/span>. \u201cThe mural does not just depict the happy aspects of Paly, but everything about it. We wanted to have an accurate depiction of the student life at Paly.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKenzie echoes these sentiments, stating that this mural's primary purpose is to bring something different to the community.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have had a really tough last couple of years, emotionally, and people from outside have wanted to come on campus to do art,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cIt felt like it was a really good time now to have students do art. It is like there is this call throughout the campus for art that was healing and uplifting and reflective of our lives.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to McKenzie, the current plan is to have at least half the mural completed by the end of this school year.\r\n\r\nZhao says that the artists are in no rush to complete the mural, as the painting is still a learning process. Painters will work in groups that rotate on different days, thereby allowing participants to work on the mural and still cover class material.\r\n\r\nMcKenzie hopes that this mural will spark a conversation about art on campus.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe reason why we are doing this is because the James Franco mural made people talk about art on campus,\" McKenzie said. \"One of the things that the art department is trying to do is to get more artistic experiences, whether it\u2019s art or music out on campus.\"\r\n\r\nAdministrators also want this mural to exhibit the works of Paly's art community.\r\n\r\n\"I think that the mural will display the talented artists that go to school here,\" Assistant Principal of Operations Jerry Berkson said. \"We really just want to show off our talented artists.\"\r\n\r\nArtists are excited to be working on the mural, as they believe they are adding their piece to the Paly legacy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that being able to paint the mural is really cool because it is a student-designed and created mural,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cI feel like it is something that was worth doing, and worth committing time to, as I am helping my school.\u201d","excerpt":"Students in the Advanced Drawing and Painting class are painting a mural on the wall of the Student Activities Center at Palo Alto High School after a James Franco mural was removed early this year.","date":"2016-04-15 16:04:15","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/IMG_0313.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Advanced Drawing and Painting Class","art","grace zhao","james franco","jerry berkson","Kate McKenzie","mural","Student Activities Center"]},{"id":119019,"title":"Liveblog: Baseball faces off against Los Gatos","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/15\/liveblog-baseball-faces-off-against-los-gatos\/","content":"Check back in at 4p.m. as the Palo Alto High School baseball team (13-2-1, 8-1) looks to maintain their first place position against the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (11-8, 7-1) at 4 p.m. Friday at home.

Givens ran the 100-meter race with a time of 10.87 seconds and Slaney ran the 800-meter race with a time of 1.57.72 minutes.\r\n\r\nAccording to sophomore Reed Foster, the team was unable to capitalize on specific events.\r\n\r\n\"We lost a lot\u00a0of points on several of the races,\" Foster said. \"That made it really hard to come back in the end. With the two-mile we really needed to sweep that and we were only able to get first and third.\"\r\n\r\nFoster said that Los Gatos is one of the toughest teams that Paly will face during the season.\r\n\r\n\"In dual meets they [Los Gatos] will be the toughest one,\" Foster said. \"I don't think that Gunn will be as hard.\"\r\n\r\nPaly's next meet is against Gunn High School, at 3:15 p.m. on Tuesday at Gunn.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School track and field team hopes to improve after suffering a tough loss to the Los Gatos High School  on Tuesday at home.","date":"2016-04-14 15:24:51","author":"Jackson Doerr","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/I9P8199.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap","Track and Field"],"tags":["2016","eli givens","kent slaney","los gatos","paly","track and field"]}]
