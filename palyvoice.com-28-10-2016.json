Additionally, members of staff spent time attending forums with all five candidates present and interviewing the incumbents on current issues.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After much deliberation as a staff, The Paly Voice has decided to endorse Todd Collins, incumbent Melissa Baten Caswell and Jennifer DiBrienza.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Todd Collins: The Fiscally Responsible\u00a0Candidate<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_122806\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"272\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6355-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-122806\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6355-1.jpg\" alt=\"Todd Collins, a candidate for school board, referenced his experiences serving on various committees to voice his perspective.

Over the years he has spent time <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">involved in various school board committees such as the Citizens\u2019 Oversight Committee of a school bond program and the school board\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/07\/school-board-delays-vote-on-opening-new-secondary-school\/\">Enrollment Management Advisory Committee<\/a> over the 2015-16 school year.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins earns our support because of his continued vocal concerns regarding the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/08\/28\/principal-no-need-to-panic-about-budget\/\">several\u00a0<\/a><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/08\/28\/principal-no-need-to-panic-about-budget\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">million dollar budget deficit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While other candidates have acknowledged the issue, he has been the only one to recognize that innovation is contingent upon the availability of funds. Collins supports new pathways and programs, but doesn\u2019t consider them to be feasible given current financial conditions.\u00a0Collins not only has the financial background, but is an asset because of his attention to detail and exposure to the board's past finances via various committees.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, in keeping with his recommendations following his time on EMAC, Collins concurs with The Paly Voice staff in <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/25\/editorial-explore-other-avenues-to-counter-overcrowding\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">standing against<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the creation of new schools within the district due to declining enrollment in elementary schools the past few years.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins persistently emphasizes the need for data-driven decision making, whether it be concerning the homework policy or the continuation of the current teacher evaluation system.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins values resiliency, an integral part of the learning process, and wants to see PAUSD students \u201cexperience and overcome failure.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Melissa Baten Caswell: The Experienced Incumbent<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caswell will be completing her second term, and while outside of the norm, electing her to a third this coming November will benefit the Palo Alto community because of her extensive knowledge regarding administrative procedures. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has previously served as board president and has experience serving on various school specific Parent Teacher Association councils.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_122810\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"302\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6360-1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-122810\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6360-1.jpg\" alt=\"Melissa Baten Caswell, who has completed two terms on the school board, acknowledged areas of improvement and strengths of the current school board.

As students we benefit from inventive programs, many of which have been implemented during her time on the board. Flipped classrooms, blended learning and programs such as Social Justice and Advanced Authentic Research allow for individualized learning experiences, enhancing our development as 21st century learners.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caswell displays some of the best features of the current board. She not only recognizes its shortcomings, but actively works to provide efficient solutions. \u00a0During school board forums she has addressed that the mission of the district is to educate its students and that the \"quality of the teachers preempts everything.\" A pragmatic decision maker, Caswell advocates for an improved system of mental health services while acknowledging<\/span>\u00a0the district\u2019s limitations.\r\n\r\nIncumbents, including Caswell, have been criticized for their lack of transparency and mismanagement in regards to finances and dealing with the Office of Civil Rights over the past few years. However, Caswell has remained consistent\u00a0in her stances and takes the time to deliberate before outlining her position. Although she voiced her <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/26\/board-approves-raise-for-teachers\/\">support for the teacher pay raise<\/a>, Caswell is in favor of aggressive measures to reduce the deficit.\r\n\r\n<b>Jennifer DiBrienza: The Needed Educator<\/b>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_122799\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"263\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6351-1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-122799\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/DSC_6351-1.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Dibrienza relied on her experiences as a Educational Consultant to provide explanations for her various stances.

Hopefully, she will help the board as a whole to recognize how each decision truly impacts the experience of a student.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Acknowledging the Competition<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabrera and Emberling have put up valiant efforts and their desire to aid the district\u2019s students should be recognized. Cabrera offers the grass-roots perspective and should be applauded for his campaign based entirely upon small donations. He offers bold ideas that would add value to innovations within any district. Similarly, Emberling\u2019s efforts over the past years have not been forgotten. Her emphasis on the best practices for each individual school is\u00a0worth noting.<\/span>\r\n\r\nCabrera, despite his ingenuity, has drawbacks; he has focused his efforts on emphasizing his\u00a0personal beliefs against the current system of politics reliant upon money. He\u00a0strays away from providing adequate solutions to the specific problems faced by our community.\r\n\r\nEmberling, despite her time on the board, does not have a consistent\u00a0stance on issues that we feel are pertinent. She has contributed to the ambiguous statements that prevent the current board from efficiently making decisions.\r\n\r\nWhile many of us as minors cannot express our support via an actual vote, our hope is to garner support for those who we believe will serve our best interests as students and community members. Their actions and decisions will outlive our legacies as Palo Alto High School students, but the election of Collins, Caswell and DiBrienza will ensure the best experience for future PAUSD students.","excerpt":"After much deliberation as a staff, The Paly Voice has decided to endorse Todd Collins, incumbent Melissa Baten Caswell and Jennifer DiBrienza.

But with three minutes left in the game, Paly was able to get a touchdown, preventing the Wildcats from securing a shutout win.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sullivan, Paly struggled with performing smaller plays.\r\n\r\n\"We started moving the ball but we hit a wall,\" Sullivan said. \"Simple execution on little things is the difference between the two scores so we've got to get better at doing that.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Sullivan, the Vikings will continue to focus on working the kinks out of their play.\r\n\r\n\"It's just doing the fine tuning that we really have to focus on,\" Sullivan said. \"We've gotten so much better over the course of the season and we're only going to keep getting better.\"\r\n\r\nSullivan said the season is far from over, and the Vikings are in competition for a spot in the playoffs.\r\n\r\n\"We're playing for a playoff spot in these next two weeks,\"\u00a0Sullivan said. \"Next week is a bye week.

In the coming days, Diorio will send out an email detailing the application process to be on the committee.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe email\u00a0will have a quick application about the committee,\" Diorio said. \"We want to have students on the committee, about five to six parents, a staff member representing each department and maybe someone from the counseling department and one administrator so it will be fairly balanced.
