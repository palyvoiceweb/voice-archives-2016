The SciOly competition is split into two teams: the green team, akin to a varsity team, and the white team, or the junior varsity team. Except for one year, Mira Loma has consistently won first at states since 2005, according\u00a0to their <a href=\"http:\/\/scioly.org\/wiki\/index.php\/Mira_Loma_High_School\">SciOly wiki page<\/a>. The only time this changed was in <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/05\/21\/paly-scioly-team-makes-impressive-debut-at-nationals\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2013<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when Paly beat Mira Loma and advanced to the Science Olympiad National Tournament and placed 16th. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/scioly.org\/wiki\/index.php\/Palo_Alto_High_School\">Paly SciOly's wiki page<\/a>, Paly has placed in the top three teams in States\u00a0since 2010.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMira Loma is an incredibly strong school,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIt is second in the nation as of last year. Considering we ended up pretty close to them is an achievement in itself.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Wang, the goal of teams at SciOly competitions is to get the lowest score possible, similar to golf. Higher-placing teams receive fewer points, while lower-placing teams successively receive higher scores. Competition events<span class=\"_5yl5\">\u00a0consist of testing, lab work and building, where teams build devices\u00a0before the competition which are then tested onsite. Events range from building a robot arm to <span class=\"_5yl5\">testing identities of unknown powders.<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough the team was somewhat disappointed that we were still stuck in a frustrating second place, we still improved from last year by three\u00a0points,\u201d sophomore green team member Chloe Hong said. \u201cIn fact, this is the smallest point gap between us and Mira Loma that we have had in all the years that we have placed second at States.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the frustration, the team did well overall and finished in the top five in many events, according to senior team captain James Wang.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEvent-wise, we did well across the board during States,\u201d James Wang said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s preparation for their tests and builds really showed during the awards ceremony. I believe we placed 5th or better in 19 out of the 23 events.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With many seniors leaving next year, some club members have voiced their anxiety about the team's future success, as Hong says that the green team will lose half of its members. SciOly adviser Ron Bowditch says he is not worried about filling the holes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have promising, bright and hard-working students coming up the ranks,\u201d Bowditch said. \u201cThe thing that is going to be different is that we are going to have a lot of students that are now on the Jordan SciOly team. Jordan did not have a SciOly team up until three years ago, so we will have a few students who were on the [Jordan SciOly] team before, giving them more experience with the competition.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to James Wang, the next step would be to find adult mentors who could help students study for their events.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere is a huge wealth of science expertise in Palo Alto that we have not really tapped [into] yet,\u201d James Wang said. \u201cI am sure that mentors would really speed up our studying and engineering processes.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nPaly's competitor, Mira Loma, has various\u00a0adult mentors that work with students one-on-one, according to Bowditch. However, he does not see Paly heading in that\u00a0direction.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI personally do not really like that idea,\u201d Bowditch said. \u201cI think the team should be completely student-run and student-focused; so when they win, it will be that much sweeter.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nMembers are excited for next season and for what it may hold.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"_5yl5\">\"I am really sad the season's over, especially since we'll be losing so many amazing seniors, but I cannot wait for the all the fun times next season,\" Celine Wang said.\r\n<\/span>","excerpt":"Continuing a three-year streak, the Palo Alto High School Science Olympiad Team placed second out of 28 teams at the North California Science Olympiad State competition on April 16, in Turlock.","date":"2016-04-25 21:27:08","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Scioly-States-story.jpeg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Bowditch","Celine Wang","chloe hong","competition","james wang","North California Science Olympiad Competition","paly scioly","science","scioly","states"]},{"id":119505,"title":"Fire alarms stall classes","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/22\/fire-alarms-stall-classes\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_119526\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Fire-alarm.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-119526\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Fire-alarm.jpg\" alt=\"Fire alarm\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/a> Students converge on the football field during the start of first period.

According to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson, construction workers in the Performing Arts Center accidentally triggered both alarms.\r\n\r\nThe first fire alarm went off before school started, forcing bewildered students to line up on the football field during the morning rain.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was raining outside and the construction workers didn\u2019t evacuate, so I was suspicious that a student pulled the alarm as a prank or to avoid their first period,\u201d junior Annabelle Hu said. \u201cI was pretty miserable in the rain. \u2026 It was a monumental waste of time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Gaby Pelayo was\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">recording a presentation in her third period Advanced Placement Spanish Language class when the fire alarm interrupted midway \u2014 ruining the recording.

All fire alarms are a hassle but considering the [AP] tests are around the corner, our classes need to be as productive as possible.\"\r\n\r\nWhile today\u2019s alarms were accidental occurrences, Paly is not a new victim of false alarms.

After winning the contest, Leinhos received\u00a0the opportunity to speak at both the annual CYIT Day and in front of the California Senate.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAs the essay winner, I\u2019ve kind of become the student face and spokesperson of this whole endeavor,\u201d Leinhos said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nWhile Leinhos says the bill will not directly affect Paly students as the current arts teachers have obtained arts teaching credentials, it could have large impacts on schools with less developed arts programs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have two very passionate arts teachers in the theater and dance departments, but in other parts of California, it may be that whichever teacher has a free period is going to teach theater,\u201d Leinhos said. \u201cIf the teacher knows exactly what they are doing and is just as passionate as the students want to be, their [students\u2019] \u00a0experience is going to be better and they\u2019re going be able to do far more with their theater experience.\u201d\r\n\r\nAllen says that the bill would help recognize the importance of dance and theater as vital elements of the arts curriculum.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCalifornia is the arts and entertainment capital of the world,\u201d Allen said. \u201cHow is it possible that ours is one of only two states in the country that does not have specific credentials for dance or theater?\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leinhos' speech will discuss both the bill and how theater affected her personally.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cI was really shy when I was younger and now I\u2019m a lot more confident and have a lot more friends [after joining theater],\u201d Leinhos said.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leinhos says she is looking forward to the experience.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think it hasn\u2019t settled in how huge this is, but I get to be a part of history,\u201d Leinhos said. \u201cIt might not seem like that huge of a part of history to some, but this [the bill] will change kids\u2019 lives if it goes through and that is so powerful. I\u2019m so glad I get to be a part of it.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School junior Nadia Leinhos will speak at the California Senate tomorrow to defend a bill which would require theater and dance teachers to obtain teaching credentials in their respective subject areas.","date":"2016-04-19 19:24:16","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13059436_1696364990623528_1698417690_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["916","arts","bill","California","dance","leinhos","nadia","paly","pe","senate","theater"]},{"id":119306,"title":"Storify: Prom 2016","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/19\/storify-prom-2016\/","content":"Look back at Palo Alto High School's Prom 2016 on Saturday\u00a0at the San Francisco Design Center\u00a0as seen through\u00a0various social media posts using the hashtag #palyprom.\r\n<div class=\"storify\">\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/storify.com\/thepalyvoice\/prom-2016\/embed?border=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"750\" frameborder=\"no\"><\/iframe><script src=\"\/\/storify.com\/thepalyvoice\/prom-2016.js?border=false\"><\/script><noscript>[&amp;lt;a href=\"\/\/storify.com\/thepalyvoice\/prom-2016\" target=\"_blank\"&amp;gt;View the story \"Prom 2016\" on Storify&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;]<\/noscript>\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Look back at Palo Alto High School's Prom 2016 on Saturday at the San Francisco Design Center as seen through various social media posts using the hashtag #palyprom.\r\n","date":"2016-04-19 18:57:08","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13035444_1767273386836890_735391528_o.jpg","categories":["Multimedia","Spotlight"],"tags":["#palyprom","paly prom","prom","prom 2016","san francisco design center"]}]
