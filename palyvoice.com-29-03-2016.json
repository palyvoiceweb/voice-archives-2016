Illustration by Portia Barrientos.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Envision sitting in your history class and taking notes on your teacher\u2019s PowerPoint lecture on India. As you copy down the word \u2018Buddhism,\u2019 you notice that the \u2018h\u2019 is slanted. Compulsively, you erase the word and rewrite it, only to erase it again because now the \u2018d\u2019 is smudged. Soon, your brain repeats the word \u2018Buddhism\u2019 over and over, and you find that you are unable to pay attention to the lecture. As this all transpires, you come to realize that not only have you missed the remainder of the Buddhism slide, but the following slide as well. For sophomore Darrow Hornik, these nettlesome compulsions are a result of obsessive-compulsive disorder.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy OCD really depends on how my day is going; if I am more stressed out, my OCD is worse,\u201d Hornik said. \u201cWhen I am in a happier mood I don\u2019t get it as much, and writing becomes a lot easier, as I am not as affected by the symptoms.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The whole OCD stereotype where everything has to be <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">super neat \u2014 that is a part of it, and I do get that as well, but there are multiple other symptoms.\"<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hornik has publicly expressed her personal journey as a student with OCD. Her talk titled \"Where are you going?\" was part of TEDx Palo Alto High School's third annual conference on March 26. Despite recent examples of online public discussion pertaining to\u00a0mental illness, with Gunn High School's student newspaper The Oracle publishing a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/gunnoracle.com\/category\/changing-the-narrative\/\">Changing the Narrative<\/a>\u00a0series aimed to spread personal stories and a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/paloaltoonline.com\/print\/story\/2016\/03\/18\/guest-opinion-unmasking-the-truth-beyond-the-stigma-of-mental-illness#.VuwTrFwPVBo.facebook\">guest column<\/a>\u00a0on Palo Alto Online, many continue to misconceive the terms and phrases often used in casual conversation.\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>What is OCD?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Lorrin Koran, M.D., a Stanford University professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by the presence of obsessions \u2014 anxiety-inducing thoughts, images or urges that a person finds difficult to dismiss from his or her mind. The obsessions lead to compulsions \u2014 behaviors that are designed to either reduce the anxiety associated with the obsession, or prevent a detrimental outcome if the person does not follow his or her obsession. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA person with OCD might be afraid that if she leaves her house and does not check the stove, there will be a fire while she is gone, leaving her responsible,\u201d Koran explains. \u201cConsequently, she will check every knob on the stove. Then, she may think that she did not check correctly, so she checks them again. She might spend five or 10 minutes checking the knobs on the stove to make sure they are off before feeling comfortable leaving the house. The obsession is the possibility of a fire and she will be responsible, while the compulsion is frequently checking the knobs.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Koran, OCD affects 1 percent to 2 percent of the population. One out of every three patients is diagnosed with OCD between the ages of three and 15; a third of the time the diagnosis occurs between 15 and 25, and the final third of diagnoses occur between 25 and 35 years old. The brain of a patient with the disorder clearly showcases physical changes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOCD from a psychiatric standpoint is a mental disorder in which there is a chemical imbalance within the brains of those diagnosed,\u201d Koran said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disorder rather than a disease because diseases are things we know the cause of. Disorders are pathological conditions that we don\u2019t know the cause of and an illness is a disease or disorder as experienced by the patient.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a definitive cause for obsessions has not been found, research has shown that its presence is related to genetics. However, exposure to particular environments can, at times, also cause OCD. According to Koran, manganese miners have been known to develop the disorder and occasionally, children who have had a strep infection suddenly develop OCD a few weeks later.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Koran, modern medicine has found two treatments to be most effective: a class of medicine known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and psychotherapy in the form of exposure and response prevention. Not all patients benefit from the prescribed methods of treatment, as 40 percent of those diagnosed will not improve after a first trial of SSRI medications; however, many of those failing to respond to initial treatment benefit from a second or third trial.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>The societal issue, defined <\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018I\u2019m so OCD\u2019 has become all too familiar of a phrase, ingrained in speech to justify moments in which one feels the need to perform an action in a certain way. Consider Buzzfeed, a social news and entertainment company that frequently amasses views through articles such as \u201c<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/peggy\/33-meticulous-cleaning-tricks-for-the-ocd-person-i#.id77mYJzJ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">33 Meticulous Cleaning Tricks For The OCD Person Inside You<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d and \u201c<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/samir\/things-that-will-drive-your-ocd-self-insane#.qyw7xrMqm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">19 Things That Will Drive Your OCD Self Insane<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d or the numerous hashtags that have emerged: #ObsessiveChristmasDisorder and #ObsessiveCrossfitDisorder. People have learned to use the disorder as a colloquialism. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only do such articles trivialize OCD and its effects, but they equate everyday \u201cobsessions\u201d with the disorder. Because \u201cobsessive\u201d is a personality trait and does not impair functioning, the mental disorder is being mixed with a personality preference.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing every lyric to \u201cHotline Bling\u201d within days of its release is not remotely similar to the irrational need to flip a light switch an even number of times before exiting a room in order to prevent something bad from happening to a loved one. When \u2018being so OCD\u2019 is correlated with words such as \u2018neat\u2019, \u2018picky\u2019 and \u2018organized\u2019, it strips the serious mental illness of its harsh reality. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe thing is, everybody assumes that people with OCD are neat freaks or germaphobes,\u201d Hornik said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t true. Sure, it\u2019s a fragment of OCD, but it is wrong to characterize that as the entire disorder. The average person is aware of and recognizes the term OCD; however, I don\u2019t think they know what OCD is and its detrimental effects it can have on a person\u2019s life.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The misuse of the term \u2018OCD\u2019 leads to misunderstandings revolving around the mental disorder itself. In fact, when people use OCD to describe themselves, they are also forgetting OCD is not an adjective and that a person cannot <\/span><b><i>be<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> OCD, but rather a person <\/span><b><i>has <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OCD.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you ask somebody \u2018Have you heard of OCD?,\u2019 they would say \u2018Of course I have,\u2019\u201d Hornik said. \u201cHowever, most are probably not aware that OCD is actually a chemical imbalance in your brain.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Delving further into the issue<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But why does society consider it inappropriate and abnormal to say, \u201cI am so cancer,\u201d while accepting the analogous statements when \u201ccancer\u201d is replaced with \u201cOCD\u201d or even \u201cdepressed\u201d? The answer? The stigma around mental illnesses. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1489832\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World Psychiatry<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which describes itself as the leading informational center devoted to the diagnosis, prevention, study and treatment of mental disorders, a majority of people hold negative attitudes and stereotypes about diagnosed patients. These people go through life hearing stereotypes such as \u2018people with mental illnesses are scary and violent.\u2019 As a result, people diagnosed with a mental disorder may be denied opportunities in everyday life, including jobs, housing and health care.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone should be ashamed to have a mental illness,\u201d Hornik said. \u201cThe stigma that is created around mental illnesses is affecting so many people\u2019s lives.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Frecceri, Paly\u2019s Mental Health and Wellness Coordinator, expanded upon the notion that a significant distinction has developed between physical and mental health, when in reality the two are equally important.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPhysical health and mental health are all apart of overall health,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cWe live in a society where there is still kind of a taboo around mental illnesses, which is kind of absurd because the brain is a physical part of the body and that\u2019s where mental illnesses live. However, we are making progress and the first step is to really raise awareness.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hornik, who has been ashamed to tell her friends that she routinely visits a therapist, stresses her experiences with the negative stigma around the disorder.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDuring Tutorial, I have to go see my therapist,\u201d Hornik said. \u201cI was dealing with the stigma around mental illnesses because I was sort of embarrassed to go see a therapist and leave every single Tutorial. My friends would ask me, \u2018Where are you going?,\u2019 and I would say, \u2018I\u2019m going to the doctor,\u2019 rather than say, \u2018I\u2019m going to the therapist to treat my mental illness.\u2019\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frecceri emphasized that a way to end the negative stigma surrounding mental illnesses is for individuals to be aware of the language they use and its effects on diagnosed patients.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think it\u2019s an opportunity for all of us, as a part of a community to continue to educate people, not to shame people, but to acknowledge that there are people who suffer from something very real and such phrases should not be used loosely,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cI think the problem is for individuals that do have a diagnosis, it [colloquial use of the illness] can feel very pejorative, that it\u2019s being used at their expense, even if it\u2019s not being used against them.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since only 1 percent to 2 percent of the population suffer from OCD, understanding the complexity of the disorder can help foster a community of support and stop individuals from suffering in silence.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen it is a mental illness like OCD, people think that you are being overly dramatic and that you can stop your brain from thinking constantly,\u201d Hornik explains. \u201cWhy is it not acceptable for me to take medicine for a chemical imbalance in my brain, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when it is acceptable to take insulin for Diabetes, which is caused by a chemical imbalance in your pancreas<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the next time your impulse is to say that you are \u2018so OCD\u2019 about something, or hop on the bandwagon that is the newest social media trend, remember that #YouAreSoNotOCD. <\/span>","excerpt":"\u2018I am so OCD\u2019 has become too familiar of a phrase, ingrained in speech to justify moments in which one feels the need to perform an action in a certain way; but this has stripped the serious mental illness of its harsh reality.

David Starr Jordan, a vocal eugenicist, or a person who\u00a0supports improving the genetic population of humans through inhumane methods, was also Stanford University\u2019s first president,\u00a0a peace activist and ichthyologist. While some may claim that changing the school\u2019s name promotes a more welcoming environment, the school board should not do so as this would not properly address contemporary racism. In addition, eugenics was considered acceptable in much of the 19th and 20th centuries despite being discredited today, and a name change would cause confusion among community members and waste District funds.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, a name change would not make the middle school\u00a0a more welcoming environment for students as it would not\u00a0properly address racism in our schools and in general. As the son of a Polish father and Mexican mother, I know my ancestors have faced racism and anti-religious sentiment firsthand. David Starr Jordan himself wrote that Poles were \"controlled by\u00a0...\u00a0animal instincts\" and Mexicans \"ignorant and \"superstitious.\"\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But although my ancestors and ethnic groups have been victimized in the past, even through ethnic cleansing and other means, I do not believe changing Jordan's\u00a0name is the proper way to address contemporary racism. Altering Jordan\u2019s name would not have made any difference in my three-year experience as a Jordan student, nor did\u00a0it make me feel marginalized or persecuted in any way.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_118411\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"392\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMAG0421.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-118411\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMAG0421.jpg\" alt=\"IMAG0421\" width=\"392\" height=\"294\" \/><\/a> Jordan Middle School, pictured above, would most likely undergo campus changes such as new paint and a new logo if the name is changed. Photo by Sherwin Amsbaugh.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the district\u00a0wishes to address modern racism, it\u00a0should not focus on Jordan Middle School\u2019s name, but rather acknowledge social injustice and discrimination in America in social studies classes or through cultural clubs. After all, Jordan's views of eugenics have been mostly discredited and bear little significance in the modern\u00a0world. Changing the school\u2019s name would not address injustice; it would simply put a bandage on a deep cut.\u00a0The change\u00a0will not suddenly transform the district into an open-minded community. Teachers and staff should encourage cultural clubs to provide an in-depth look into social justice rather than bring attention to a name that many are unaware about if they wish to make schools more welcoming.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One may say that the district can both change the name and acknowledge social injustice in schools. While this is true,\u00a0there are other and more effective ways to make students feel welcome rather than\u00a0changing Jordan's name. Administration can use funds that may otherwise go to repainting the school to crack down on bullying and fund cultural programs, both of which are more likely to successfully promote tolerance and unity.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is terrible that David Starr Jordan fostered racist ideologies, he should not just be recognized as a eugenicist when he also promoted pacifism and contributed to the field of science. America\u2019s fourth president, Thomas Jefferson, is revered as a hero despite owning over 600 slaves. Similarly, Jordan should not be edited out of our history due to some of\u00a0his views which while inhumane, were standard in the late 19th century. It must be noted that at its peak, eugenics was supported by W.E.B Dubois, Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, all of whom are considered heroes in today's society. This does not mean that Jordan should be excused for his views, as they promoted racism in the 20th century. Rather,\u00a0we should look at his views in context and acknowledge that what is considered racist today was seen as standard 80\u00a0years ago.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to American historian and biographer Garland E. Allen, David Starr Jordan\u2019s views were considered common in his time.\r\n\r\n\u201cEugenics ... was a widespread and popular movement in the United States and Europe between 1910 and 1940,\u201d Garland wrote. \u201cEugenics gained much support from progressive reform thinkers, who sought to plan social development using expert knowledge in both the social and natural sciences.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changing a school\u2019s name because some find it offensive may also set a dangerous precedent. Basically every influential figure has been subject to some form of controversy, regardless of the nobility of their deeds. If we wished to avoid offending all Palo Altans, we would need to rename schools to streets, plants or locations.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A name change would foster additional consequences. Administration would most likely paint over all Jordan Middle School logos and alter all paperwork referring to the school as \u201cJordan,\u201d costing the district an unknown amount of money which could be better spent on new textbooks or educational facilities. The change could also cause confusion among citizens who are unaware of the name replacement.<\/span>\r\n\r\nDespite the name change's potential negative effects, some students continue to advocate for such a modification.\u00a0Social Justice Pathway\u00a0student and junior Layla Solatan says she\u00a0believes it would help create a more welcoming environment.\r\n\r\n\"Now that people have shown such passion for changing the name, to ignore their pleas would do harm to the image, values and environment of the district,\" Solatan said.\r\n\r\nHowever, a majority of students do not believe the name has a significant impact on them. The Voice visited random Paly English classrooms and posted a survey in the class Facebook groups to see how students felt about such a change. Of the 219 netted responses,\u00a0only 28.8 percent of students believe the current name creates an unhealthy environment for students, and 40.6\u00a0percent\u00a0support an actual name change. 68.5 percent of those who responded attended Jordan Middle School. These results demonstrate how, despite a\u00a0vehement\u00a0minority of students urging for a name change,\u00a0these students\u00a0do not represent their peers' views as a whole.\r\n\r\nSchool board member Melissa Baten Caswell says that while changing the name could set a positive example of upstanding,\u00a0it also could cause multiple community problems.\r\n\r\n\"There will be expenses involved with changing the name,\" Caswell said. \"Some members of the community are attached to the existing name.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the school board's advisory committee reaches a conclusion on the name's effects later this year, we should definitely listen and take into account their research and advice. However, at this point in time, a\u00a0Jordan name change is completely unnecessary. Further discussions about promoting tolerance in Palo Alto schools\u00a0are important and will help to create a healthier, more open-minded community\u2014but a Jordan name change is not the solution.","excerpt":"A Jordan Middle School name change is unnecessary due to potential costs and confusion as well as the fact that eugenics, while an atrocious practice, was universally accepted in the early 20th century.","date":"2016-03-24 21:09:40","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/unnamed.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["Alto","David","Eugenics","garland allen","jordan","middle","name","Palo","paly","racism","scandal","School","starr"]},{"id":118458,"title":"Band and orchestra win first place in New York City","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/03\/24\/band-and-orchestra-win-first-place-in-new-york-city\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_118461\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"520\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-10.33.45-AM1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-118461\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-10.33.45-AM1.png\" alt=\"Paly Band preforms on the quad for Arts in Unusual places.

It [the stigma] could be because\u00a0we\u2019re right across from Stanford and are a high-achieving school. Currently around 12 to 15 percent of seniors go to a community college,\u00a0but I want to make sure everyone knows what options are out there.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laguna believes that community colleges offer several benefits, some of which she personally experienced. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere have been plenty of Paly alumni who have been eligible to attend a four-year college but chose to go to community college for numerous reasons,\" Laguna said. \"Whether if it\u2019s they aren\u2019t ready yet, don\u2019t know what they want to major or that community college is cheaper. I personally was not strong in math but was able to really take my time and get better at math so that once I transferred to a four year, I had not only completed math but mastered the subject.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School hopes to educate students about community colleges through guest speakers, tours and workshops during its inaugural Community College Week which starts on Monday.","date":"2016-03-21 12:02:38","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/rsz_image_3-1.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["college","community center","community college","community college week","ivy league","laguna","palo alto high","stanford","stigma"]},{"id":118112,"title":"Admin cautions prospective senior pranksters","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/03\/19\/admin-cautions-prospective-senior-pranksters\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_118116\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"499\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/photo.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-118116\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/photo.jpg\" alt=\"Senior pranks have always been apart of Palo Alto High School according to assistant Principal of operations, Jerry Berkson.

Paly split its matches with Cupertino. Photo by Sam Lee.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School boys' tennis team split its two matches against Cupertino High School on Thursday\u00a0at Palo Alto High School.\r\n\r\nAccording to head coach Andy Harader, the team played two matches to make up for one that had been rained out earlier in the season. Instead of playing the two matches on separate days, both teams decided to play both matches on the same day in a compressed version.\r\n\r\n\u201cNormally, our league rules say you have to play two out of three sets,\u201d Harader said. \u201cBut because we were rained out and more rain is expected next week, we thought in order to expedite the matter we decided to try and fit them in one day. In order to do that, we played pro sets which allowed us to finish both matches in a day.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Harader, pro sets involve playing one set in which\u00a0the winner gets to eight games, instead of the traditional best out of three sets where the winner of each set is the first to six games.\r\n\r\nJunior Henry Badger said that despite the difficulty of playing the pro set style as opposed to the traditional three-set match, it was beneficial for the team's circumstances.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe pro set format is very tough, because unless you start off well, it is hard to win matches,\u201d Badger said. \u201cI prefer the best out of three set matches because it shows consistency and is better for the player mentally. However, I think the pro set format worked well in this circumstance.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the first match, the Vikings beat the Pioneers four matches to three. Despite senior Shiv Matta retiring due to fatigue, the Vikings were lifted by victories from senior Carl Goodfriend and junior Adrian Smith, among others.\r\n\r\nSmith was able to use his consistent groundstrokes to force his opponents into making unforced errors.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was able to stay consistent and keep my opponent on the run, which ended up being the deciding factor of the match,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMy opponent had trouble staying motivated when on the run so I decided to wait for him to miss instead of me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHarader also praised one of his team\u2019s double teams, made up of Badger and sophomore Hunter North, who were able to win both of their matches on the day. Badger attributed his success to his effective forehand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was able to win my match by staying consistent and managing to keep my serve in and effective,\u201d Badger said. \u201cI tried focusing on my forehand during the second match and tried to stay more consistent in that area.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings were unable to carry their momentum into the second match and ended up dropping it five matches to two.\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing a match that involved vomiting by multiple players due to fatigue and possible heat exhaustion, Harader believes that conditions played a role in the Vikings\u2019 loss.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, in both matches we had sickness,\u201d Harader said. \u201cThis is the first hot day and we played two matches in hot conditions. We probably need to condition more so that we are in better shape when we go into this kind of depth in a match situation.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter the loss, junior Jerry Hong said that the goal for the rest of the year is to make it to the postseason.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe're hoping that we can get the 50 percent win rate we need for us to qualify to CCS [Central Coast Section],\u201d Hong said. \u201cWe'll just need to keep working hard and playing our best.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' next match is against Monta Vista High School at 3:30 p.m. next Tuesday at Monta Vista High School.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' tennis team split its two matches against Cupertino High School on Thursday at Palo Alto High School.
