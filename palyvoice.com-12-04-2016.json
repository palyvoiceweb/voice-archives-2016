As this all transpires, you come to realize that not only have you missed the remainder of the Buddhism slide, but the following slide as well. For sophomore Darrow Hornik, these nettlesome compulsions are a result of obsessive-compulsive disorder.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy OCD really depends on how my day is going; if I am more stressed out, my OCD is worse,\u201d Hornik said. \u201cWhen I am in a happier mood I don\u2019t get it as much, and writing becomes a lot easier, as I am not as affected by the symptoms.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The whole OCD stereotype where everything has to be <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">super neat \u2014 that is a part of it, and I do get that as well, but there are multiple other symptoms.\"<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hornik has publicly expressed her personal journey as a student with OCD. Her talk titled \"Where are you going?\" was part of TEDx Palo Alto High School's third annual conference on March 26. Despite recent examples of online public discussion pertaining to\u00a0mental illness, with Gunn High School's student newspaper The Oracle publishing a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/gunnoracle.com\/category\/changing-the-narrative\/\">Changing the Narrative<\/a>\u00a0series aimed to spread personal stories and a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/paloaltoonline.com\/print\/story\/2016\/03\/18\/guest-opinion-unmasking-the-truth-beyond-the-stigma-of-mental-illness#.VuwTrFwPVBo.facebook\">guest column<\/a>\u00a0on Palo Alto Online, many continue to misconceive the terms and phrases often used in casual conversation.\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>What is OCD?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Lorrin Koran, M.D., a Stanford University professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by the presence of obsessions \u2014 anxiety-inducing thoughts, images or urges that a person finds difficult to dismiss from his or her mind. The obsessions lead to compulsions \u2014 behaviors that are designed to either reduce the anxiety associated with the obsession, or prevent a detrimental outcome if the person does not follow his or her obsession. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA person with OCD might be afraid that if she leaves her house and does not check the stove, there will be a fire while she is gone, leaving her responsible,\u201d Koran explains. \u201cConsequently, she will check every knob on the stove. Then, she may think that she did not check correctly, so she checks them again. She might spend five or 10 minutes checking the knobs on the stove to make sure they are off before feeling comfortable leaving the house. The obsession is the possibility of a fire and she will be responsible, while the compulsion is frequently checking the knobs.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Koran, OCD affects 1 percent to 2 percent of the population. One out of every three patients is diagnosed with OCD between the ages of three and 15; a third of the time the diagnosis occurs between 15 and 25, and the final third of diagnoses occur between 25 and 35 years old. The brain of a patient with the disorder clearly showcases physical changes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOCD from a psychiatric standpoint is a mental disorder in which there is a chemical imbalance within the brains of those diagnosed,\u201d Koran said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disorder rather than a disease because diseases are things we know the cause of. Disorders are pathological conditions that we don\u2019t know the cause of and an illness is a disease or disorder as experienced by the patient.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a definitive cause for obsessions has not been found, research has shown that its presence is related to genetics. However, exposure to particular environments can, at times, also cause OCD. According to Koran, manganese miners have been known to develop the disorder and occasionally, children who have had a strep infection suddenly develop OCD a few weeks later.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Koran, modern medicine has found two treatments to be most effective: a class of medicine known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and psychotherapy in the form of exposure and response prevention. Not all patients benefit from the prescribed methods of treatment, as 40 percent of those diagnosed will not improve after a first trial of SSRI medications; however, many of those failing to respond to initial treatment benefit from a second or third trial.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>The societal issue, defined <\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018I\u2019m so OCD\u2019 has become all too familiar of a phrase, ingrained in speech to justify moments in which one feels the need to perform an action in a certain way. Consider Buzzfeed, a social news and entertainment company that frequently amasses views through articles such as \u201c<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/peggy\/33-meticulous-cleaning-tricks-for-the-ocd-person-i#.id77mYJzJ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">33 Meticulous Cleaning Tricks For The OCD Person Inside You<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d and \u201c<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/samir\/things-that-will-drive-your-ocd-self-insane#.qyw7xrMqm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">19 Things That Will Drive Your OCD Self Insane<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d or the numerous hashtags that have emerged: #ObsessiveChristmasDisorder and #ObsessiveCrossfitDisorder. People have learned to use the disorder as a colloquialism. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only do such articles trivialize OCD and its effects, but they equate everyday \u201cobsessions\u201d with the disorder. Because \u201cobsessive\u201d is a personality trait and does not impair functioning, the mental disorder is being mixed with a personality preference.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing every lyric to \u201cHotline Bling\u201d within days of its release is not remotely similar to the irrational need to flip a light switch an even number of times before exiting a room in order to prevent something bad from happening to a loved one. When \u2018being so OCD\u2019 is correlated with words such as \u2018neat\u2019, \u2018picky\u2019 and \u2018organized\u2019, it strips the serious mental illness of its harsh reality. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe thing is, everybody assumes that people with OCD are neat freaks or germaphobes,\u201d Hornik said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t true. Sure, it\u2019s a fragment of OCD, but it is wrong to characterize that as the entire disorder. The average person is aware of and recognizes the term OCD; however, I don\u2019t think they know what OCD is and its detrimental effects it can have on a person\u2019s life.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The misuse of the term \u2018OCD\u2019 leads to misunderstandings revolving around the mental disorder itself. In fact, when people use OCD to describe themselves, they are also forgetting OCD is not an adjective and that a person cannot <\/span><b><i>be<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> OCD, but rather a person <\/span><b><i>has <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OCD.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you ask somebody \u2018Have you heard of OCD?,\u2019 they would say \u2018Of course I have,\u2019\u201d Hornik said. \u201cHowever, most are probably not aware that OCD is actually a chemical imbalance in your brain.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Delving further into the issue<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But why does society consider it inappropriate and abnormal to say, \u201cI am so cancer,\u201d while accepting the analogous statements when \u201ccancer\u201d is replaced with \u201cOCD,\" \u201cdepressed\" or even \"retarded\"? The answer? The stigma around mental illnesses. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1489832\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World Psychiatry<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which describes itself as the leading informational center devoted to the diagnosis, prevention, study and treatment of mental disorders, a majority of people hold negative attitudes and stereotypes about diagnosed patients. These people go through life hearing stereotypes such as \u2018people with mental illnesses are scary and violent.\u2019 As a result, people diagnosed with a mental disorder may be denied opportunities in everyday life, including jobs, housing and health care.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone should be ashamed to have a mental illness,\u201d Hornik said. \u201cThe stigma that is created around mental illnesses is affecting so many people\u2019s lives.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Frecceri, Paly\u2019s Mental Health and Wellness Coordinator, expanded upon the notion that a significant distinction has developed between physical and mental health, when in reality the two are equally important.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPhysical health and mental health are all apart of overall health,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cWe live in a society where there is still kind of a taboo around mental illnesses, which is kind of absurd because the brain is a physical part of the body and that\u2019s where mental illnesses live. However, we are making progress and the first step is to really raise awareness.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hornik, who has been ashamed to tell her friends that she routinely visits a therapist, stresses her experiences with the negative stigma around the disorder.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDuring Tutorial, I have to go see my therapist,\u201d Hornik said. \u201cI was dealing with the stigma around mental illnesses because I was sort of embarrassed to go see a therapist and leave every single Tutorial. My friends would ask me, \u2018Where are you going?,\u2019 and I would say, \u2018I\u2019m going to the doctor,\u2019 rather than say, \u2018I\u2019m going to the therapist to treat my mental illness.\u2019\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frecceri emphasized that a way to end the negative stigma surrounding mental illnesses is for individuals to be aware of the language they use and its effects on diagnosed patients.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think it\u2019s an opportunity for all of us, as a part of a community to continue to educate people, not to shame people, but to acknowledge that there are people who suffer from something very real and such phrases should not be used loosely,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cI think the problem is for individuals that do have a diagnosis, it [colloquial use of the illness] can feel very pejorative, that it\u2019s being used at their expense, even if it\u2019s not being used against them.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since only 1 percent to 2 percent of the population suffer from OCD, understanding the complexity of the disorder can help foster a community of support and stop individuals from suffering in silence.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen it is a mental illness like OCD, people think that you are being overly dramatic and that you can stop your brain from thinking constantly,\u201d Hornik explains. \u201cWhy is it not acceptable for me to take medicine for a chemical imbalance in my brain, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when it is acceptable to take insulin for Diabetes, which is caused by a chemical imbalance in your pancreas<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the next time your impulse is to say that you are \u2018so OCD\u2019 about something, or hop on the bandwagon that is the newest social media trend, remember that #YouAreSoNotOCD. <\/span>","excerpt":"\u2018I am so OCD\u2019 has become too familiar of a phrase, ingrained in speech to justify moments in which one feels the need to perform an action in a certain way; but this has stripped the serious mental illness of its harsh reality.
