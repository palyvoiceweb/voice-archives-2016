Photo: \u00a9 2016-Marvel Studios[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Captain America: Civil War\" directors Joe and Anthony Russo tell the story of the conflict between two central characters in the Marvel Universe, succeeding in some areas but falling short in others. Based off of a Marvel comic of the same name, \"Civil War\" revolves around the the growing rift between Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans). As the situation escalates, their friends are forced to choose sides and fight.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins with a bang, as Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) accidentally causes an explosion, killing several civilians which leads to the question of whether the Avengers should be regulated. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) approaches the Avengers with a plan to place them under United Nations control, no longer allowing them to operate independently.  Lines are drawn quickly as Iron Man voices his support for the plan, along with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). Captain America is against the plan and refuses to obey them, putting him and Iron Man on opposing sides.\r\n\r\nDespite all this, the plan proposed by Ross is not the main source of conflict. This instead comes from the reappearance of the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), and the introduction of a mysterious villain Helmut Zemo, (Daniel Bruhl). It is the lengths that Captain America goes to protect his friend, and the loyalty that he has towards him that drives the conflict and results in quite possibly the most spectacular battle scene in the Marvel franchise, bringing together all of the Avengers and some extras as Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) all choose sides and fight.\r\n\r\nWhere the movie falls flat, however, is the main underlying story. Captain America and Iron Man are friends, then they fight, but then they become friends again? Wait, no, they're fighting again. The final fight between the two just feels too forced; there isn't really a rational reason behind it. In addition, the main villain, Zemo, doesn't seem to convey a serious threat. His motives are clear, but his plan is simply too convoluted. He does however participate in a nice little twist that breaks away from the standard Marvel formula. Despite this Zemo simply isn't given enough room to work a screen, creating a flimsy antagonist, a problem that Marvel movies have been repeating, with the exception of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in \"The Avengers.\" \r\n\r\nOne of the best parts of the movie is the addition of Spider-Man, who makes his debut in the Marvel cinematic universe. With Sony's release of the Spider-Man license, Marvel is now able to use the character in future movies. Holland nails the role of a teen superhero, with all the quips and jokes that the superhero is supposed to have. He is the first movie version of Spider-Man that actually feels and acts like a kid. Despite only appearing in the movie for a brief moment, he absolutely steals the spotlight, overshadowing the introduction of another key Marvel character, Black Panther. Nonetheless, Black Panther is a welcome addition to the movie and has a solid subplot to the overall story.\r\n\r\nWhile not on the same level as \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\", \"Civil War\" manages to deliver a solid package. The introduction of new characters (Spider-Man!) and some incredible fight scenes more than make up for a shaky plot. If you enjoy any Marvel movie, do yourself a favor and go see this one.\r\n\r\n<strong> Captain America: Civil War\r\n2 hours 27 minutes\r\nRated PG-13\r\nDirected by Joe and Anthony Russo\r\nStarring Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan<\/strong>\r\n","excerpt":" Based off of a Marvel comic of the same name, \"Civil War\" revolves around the the growing rift between Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans).

Photo: Eli Zucker[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School Robotics team looks to continue this year's success after scoring in the top 30 in its division at last weekend\u2019s FIRST Robotics Competition World Championships in St. Louis.\r\n\r\nThe team, also known as Team 8, ranked 27 out of 75 teams in their division. According to sophomore team member Bert Davies, 600 teams around the world, including nations such as Canada and Israel, participated in the competition.\r\n\r\nDuring the competition, teams are randomly matched together and work with each other to score the most points in a certain amount of time, according to Davies. Teams can score points by crossing barriers with their robots or shooting balls into a tower. Robots are controlled remotely by drivers. The alliance that wins the match gets points added to its cumulative score. The top three teams from each of the eight divisions advance to the playoffs.\r\n\r\nTeam 8 qualified to the competition through a series of wild cards during the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/18\/robotics-team-to-compete-at-world-championship\/\">Central Valley Regional<\/a>, according to Davies. At Regionals, the top 10 teams were selected to go compete at Worlds. However, some of the top 10 teams were already guaranteed a spot at Worlds, leaving empty spots up for grabs. Therefore, even though Paly was not in the top 10, Team 8 filled the empty spots, thereby giving them a place to compete at Worlds.\r\n\r\nAt Worlds, although Team 8 did not end up placing in the finals, team members say that they are still very grateful for the experience.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were able to watch exciting matches of all of the world-class teams,\u201d sophomore scouting and strategy captain Shota Yamamoto said. \u201cThe experience was great because we got to talk to teams from all over the world and learn about how their teams function in terms of team structure, their design phase and many other things.\u201d\r\n\r\nTeam members were also able to learn more about robotics and different design tips and tricks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were a ton of really cool workshops discussing how to improve your robot,\u201d Davies said.\r\n\r\nLooking towards next year, the team is looking to make changes to improve the team's efficiency.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want to have a stronger team structure and stay a bit more organized,\u201d Yamamoto said. \u201cAnother thing we are aiming for is more diversity on the team, with a better ratio of guys to girls.\u201d\r\n\r\nRobotics students\u00a0have started a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyrobotics.com\/summercamp\">summer outreach program<\/a> for middle school students from around the Bay Area to attend, according to Yamamoto. The camp will teach different skills for robotics, including data analysis and coding. They have also separately created a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firstinspires.org\/robotics\/fll\">FIRST Lego League<\/a> team for middle school students to build and compete with Lego robots.\r\n\r\nAccording to team members, robotics provides a great place for students to learn about robotics and build a community.\r\n\r\n\u201cI love robotics because the people on the team are really nice to each other,\u201d Yamamoto said. \u201cEveryone on the team is really close with each other too. Another thing is that it is not just about building a robot. At competition ... each team has to compete with two other random teams [as allies]. In order to succeed in these matches, your alliance has to communicate with each other ... I love robotics because I have gained and learned so much about technical skills, leadership skills and communication skills.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith members hoping to advance to Worlds again next year, they have already started preparing and tinkering with their current robot.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the next step, I want to build a whole new robot for practice, using the information and tips we gained at Worlds,\u201d Davies said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Robotics team looks to continue this year's success after scoring in the top 30 in its division at last weekend\u2019s FIRST Robotics Competition World Championships in St. Louis.","date":"2016-05-05 17:47:54","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Chris-Linn-image-95.jpeg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Bert Davies","First Lego League","FIRST Robotics World Championships","paly robotics","Shota Yamamoto","team 8","Worlds"]},{"id":119985,"title":"One Acts to showcase student creativity","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/05\/one-acts-to-showcase-student-creativity\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_120100\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"323\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/13169814_1123054514425884_1449289915_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-120100\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/13169814_1123054514425884_1449289915_o.jpg\" alt=\"13169814_1123054514425884_1449289915_o\" width=\"323\" height=\"431\" \/><\/a> Sophomore Peter King (left)\u00a0and junior Declan Flanders\u00a0(right) act as cows for the one act \"Cow Play,\" directed by senior Ophir Sneh. \"Cow Play\" is the only student-written play this year.\u00a0Photo by Takaaki Sagawa.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School theater department will showcase\u00a0a realm\u00a0of\u00a0student-run\u00a0plays in\u00a0its annual One Acts production from Thursday to\u00a0Saturday in the Haymarket Theatre.\r\n\r\nThe production will consist of seven one-act plays, all of which feature student producers, directors and actors.

The scripts \u201cHorse Girls\u201d by former student\u00a0Lily Dodd\u00a0and \u201cDo Engineers Dream of Androids?\u201d by Paly alumna Miranda Cohn will also be featured.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's much more fun to work on the student-written scripts because it's not so rigid,\u201d O'Reilly said. \u201cIf you want to do something fun and exciting on one of the plays that is student-written, it's just a matter of asking that person.\u201d\r\n\r\nUnlike\u00a0the traditional fall and spring Paly theater productions, One Acts encourages students who are\u00a0not usual participants of the arts\u00a0to\u00a0perform, according to O'Reilly. For\u00a0senior Clara Chiu who took part\u00a0in theater as a child, this production is\u00a0the perfect occasion to explore acting once more\u00a0through her role in \u201cLove (Awkwardly).\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think One Acts is awesome because it presents the opportunity for people who haven't really done theater or aren't really experienced to have that opportunity to explore it,\u201d Chiu said.\r\n\r\nOne Acts will be performed at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

[I] just try to attack hitters.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly struck first with an RBI single by senior right fielder Owen Plambeck, allowing senior third baseman Riley Schoeben to score. \r\n\r\nThe Vikings continued to stretch the lead in the second inning with a triple by senior Lawrence Han, scoring sophomore second baseman Max Jung-Goldberg and senior first baseman Alec Olmstead. Junior center fielder Ben Cleasby also singled, bringing Han home to make the score 4-0.\r\n\r\nPaly piled on five more runs in the third inning, building up a cushion that allowed the Vikings cruise through the rest of the game. \r\n\r\nDespite losing to Los Altos 1-0 earlier in the season, the Vikings felt prepared to take on the Eagles from the get-go, according to Hull.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we were all pretty ready, pretty pumped up about this game, playoffs are obviously a little more high-stakes,\u201d Hull said. \u201cI think we were just confident going in, and we got to them early, and kind of cruised on from there.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team\u2019s win puts them in a good position for their overall ranking at Leagues. \r\n\r\n\u201cIf we win [Leagues], we have Finals next week, and then on to CCS,\u201d Plambeck said. \u201c[We] got them again on Thursday; you have to put them away with a sweep.\u201d\r\n\r\nHull said that the Vikings will be able to win the second game, and thus the series, if they continue their performance from yesterday.\r\n\r\n\u201cLooking ahead to Thursday, hopefully we\u2019ll do something that\u2019s pretty similar: go out, score runs early, and keep doing it,\u201d Hull said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will play game two against the Eagles at 4 p.m. on Thursday at home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School baseball team (20-4-1, 12-2) crushed the Los Altos Eagles (15-12-0, 8-6) 9-0 yesterday at home in the first round of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League playoffs.
