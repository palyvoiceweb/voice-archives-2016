I guess we\u2019re [admin] trying to grapple with why people are opting out.\u201d\r\n\r\nCalifornia Education Code \u00a760615 permits students to opt out of California tests if their school receives a note of excuse from their parents. Last year about 50 percent of juniors <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/27\/where-is-everyone-students-opt-out-of-smarter-balanced-test\/\">opted out of the SBAC<\/a>.\r\n\r\nWith such a small number of student participants, the administration will not be able to receive an accurate score of how the student body is performing academically.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need a 95 percent threshold to get a score for the school to get accurate data, which obviously we didn\u2019t hit,\u201d Paulson said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Paulson, the administration can do little to ensure that students take the test.\r\n\r\n\u201cObviously we want more kids to participate, but a lot of it is out of our hands,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural thing. Students don\u2019t see the benefit in it [the SBAC].\u201d\r\n\r\nLast week, Principal Kim Diorio <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/16\/smarter-balance-testing-to-begin-tomorrow\/\">encouraged students<\/a> to take the test via a Schoology message.\r\n\r\n\"Smarter Balanced Testing is a low stakes assessment for students but a high-stakes test for our high school and it's state-wide and national rankings, as well as being the primary source for school-wide data to inform our WASC continuous improvement process,\" Diorio wrote.\r\n\r\nJunior Dani Macuil says she opted out of the test as it occurred shortly after Advanced Placement exams and a few weeks before final exams.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to Smarter Balance testing because I felt like it was unfair to ask students to do another week of testing on top of APs and getting ready for finals,\u201d Macuil said. \u201cI also knew that 95 percent of students wouldn\u2019t show up; therefore, it would be pointless to go anyways because it still wouldn\u2019t meet the requirements.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Lydia Miller, her class experienced\u00a0several technical issues on the first day of testing.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost of the computers didn\u2019t have it [the exam] on there,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe had to go from computer to computer to see which had the test on it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the test, classes partook in discussions about the parts of a coffee cup to help solve math equations about a cup. On the second day, English teachers conducted a discussion about the definition of poetry and prose before starting the exam. While some students found the introduction helpful, others including junior Isabella Bernard found the discussions unhelpful in solving the problems and said they only wasted time.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [the discussions] weren't\u00a0even relevant to the problems,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to know any of it to do the problems.\u201d","excerpt":"Approximately 75 percent of Palo Alto High School juniors opted out of the Smarter Balanced test on Tuesday and Wednesday.","date":"2016-05-19 22:29:35","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/13225152_1706672769592750_1831332758_o.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["balanced","exam","sbac","smarter","test"]},{"id":120344,"title":"City ordinance prohibits inflatables during Field Day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/19\/city-ordinance-prohibits-inflatables-during-field-day\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_72113\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"440\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo-3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72113\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo-3.jpg\" alt=\"Junior Meera Bhide exits a large, blow-up slide that is included at every field day.

What makes a release of emotions beautiful is when an artist is able to spin it into a more positive, hopeful message.\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s visual album \"Lemonade,\" released in late April, has a meaningful message that goes beyond the topic of her husband's infidelity. It is an empowering visual album that showcases the strength of women and African Americans.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Her hour-long music video incorporates all of the songs in the album with each song representing a different emotional stage. In between and throughout each song Beyonc\u00e9 provides moving narration that includes religious references, reflections on her life and historical events. Although sometimes it can be hard to understand the entire message, the variety of ways to analyze the composition makes \"Lemonade\"\u00a0a literature geek's dream.<\/p>\r\nThe stages of grief represented in the album include intuition, denial, anger, apathy, emptiness, accountability, reformation, forgiveness, resurrection, hope and redemption. Although all of these stages include a unique and powerful message, here are some of the most memorable components in Beyonc\u00e9's\u00a0visual album.\r\n\r\nAfter the first song \u201cPray You Catch Me,\u201d which is in the intuition stage and is the introduction to her visual album, Beyonc\u00e9 provides narration as she is captured swimming in an underwater bedroom. The tempo\u00a0is very slow, providing an eerie effect to the scene as Beyonc\u00e9 sings a variety of melodious harmonies. The lyrics add to the sinister tone with phrases like \"pray to catch you whispering.\"\r\n\r\nShe then\u00a0transitions into the next song \u2014 \u201cHold Up,\u201d the denial stage. \u201cHold Up\u201d begins with Beyonc\u00e9 wearing\u00a0a striking yellow dress as she opens the doors and water floods out from the bedroom. This is one of the most famous clips from her music video and she is seen smashing cars with a bat strutting down the street. \u201cHold Up\u201d provides a reggae vibe that is peaceful and soothing, which is a striking contrast to\u00a0her violent actions in the video when\u00a0she smashes cars while\u00a0swinging a bat. \u00a0The medium pace of the song is well thought out, making the scene just the right tempo instead of too rushed. Throughout the denial stage, Beyonc\u00e9 portrays herself as delighted as\u00a0she destroys\u00a0the cars and the streets. Towards the end of this scene, children and others gather behind Beyonc\u00e9 as they join her\u00a0in the streets. This portrayal\u00a0of solidarity showcases the surprising aspect of the scene: for a song about denial, the tune is almost happy and unnervingly relaxed.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_50211\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"488\"]<img class=\"wp-image-50211\" src=\"http:\/\/thevandallist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Watch-Beyonc%C3%A9%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9CLemonade%E2%80%9D-HBO-Album-Movie-the-vandallist-2.jpg\" alt=\"Watch Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d HBO Album Movie - the vandallist (2)\" width=\"488\" height=\"276\" \/> Beyonc\u00e9 struts down the streets wearing a yellow dress and destroying cars with a bat in the song \"Hold Up,\" the denial stage of grief. Photo from Beyonc\u00e9's visual album.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the anger stage with the song \"Don't Hurt Yourself (ft. Jack White)\" the visual album flashes the phrase, \u201cGod is God and I am not.\u201d It then leads into the next song \"Sorry,\" the apathy stage, featuring No. 1 ranked women\u2019s tennis player Serena Williams in the song. The faster beat and sassiness of\u00a0the song embodies more of the diva and \u201cqueen\u201d that Beyonc\u00e9 is known to be. Serena Williams and Beyonc\u00e9 dance around a room and a bus as they sing \u201cI ain\u2019t sorry\u201d repeatedly. This song is most popular for the lyrics, \u201cBecky with the good hair,\u201d which has sprung controversy as to who Becky is and if it has to do with Jay Z\u2019s cheating scandal.\r\n\r\n\u201cSandcastles\u201d is Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most vulnerable song as it is the forgiveness stage and features Jay-Z. She is pictured laying with a veil over her head standing in the ocean. The song itself is slowed down with the simplicity of the piano playing in the background. \"Sandcastles\" shows a softer side to Beyonc\u00e9 as her voice cracks, emphasizing raw emotion and her personal struggles. With Jay-Z featured in this stage, she shows vulnerability and allows the public to see a glimpse of their personal lives. In her narration component, Beyonc\u00e9 includes phrases like, \"Baptize me. \u2026 If we\u2019re gonna heal let it be glorious\u201d and \u201c1,000 girls raise their arms,\u201d a message of empowerment and hope that incorporates religious terms. This song perfectly contrasts to the rest of the album, providing almost a spiritual moment of relief in a storm of strong emotions.\r\n\r\n\"Freedom\" is the stage of hope and is the epitome of female\u00a0empowerment as many strong women like Zendaya, Winnie Harlow and Ava Clarke are featured in this song. The song \"Forward\" is the resurrection stage and also has powerful imagery as the mothers of several black men who were killed in the last couple of years were are shown holding pictures of their loved ones. This strong message shows how Beyonc\u00e9 is willing to stand up for her beliefs in her music, making it clear that this an issue calling out\u00a0for awareness and compassion.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll Night,\u201d the redemption stage shows many home video clips of\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s family as well as other unknown people and is a bittersweet ending to her visual album. This has a much more peaceful and lighter vibe as it shows Beyonc\u00e9 getting a matching \u201cfour\u201d tattoo with her husband Jay-Z, as well as letting the public in on their wedding night with\u00a0other couples who are unknown, smiling and having a good time together. All of these clips are happy, memorable events. It is a touching way to end her visual album as the song \"Formation\" is only featured in the end credits. She ends the song with \u201cHow I missed you my love\u201d in a haunting whisper.\r\n\r\nBeyonc\u00e9 uses this visual album as a platform to show her beliefs of women and black empowerment. However, the visual album has a much deeper message than a way of getting revenge on Jay-Z. It illustrates her versatility\u00a0as an artist: she can do anything from a touching slow song to a powerful, fast-paced pop song. However, the one complaint is that the songs are a bit repetitive, all over the place and not as cohesive because they seem to be there to supplement the visual aspect of the album. But this is Beyonc\u00e9 we're talking about \u2014 she can pull off any genre and make\u00a0the music as catchy as always.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Beyonce\u2019s visual album Lemonade has a meaningful message that goes beyond the topic of her husband.

We\u2019re seeing a trend across the nation of parents and students exercising that right.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to California Education Code \u00a760615, parents are allowed to let their children opt out of California standardized tests, such as the Smarter Balanced test, if the school's main office receives a handwritten note of excuse from parents.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Smarter Balanced Test is to measure the strength of a school\u2019s curriculum, according Diorio. In a recent email sent to juniors and their parents, Diorio encouraged students to take the test.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile the results of the test will not be included on your transcript and will not be used in the college admission process, the results will be used to assess the quality of our school and its programs,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nThere are several ramifications of a low participation rate, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn order to maintain our excellent rankings and strong reputation, both locally and nationally, it\u2019s important that we reach a 95 percent participation rate,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nIn addition to impacting the school\u2019s reputation, the tests can also help students, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe results from the Smarter Balance tests may be used to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Gold State Seal Merit Diploma, State Seal of Biliteracy and California State University's Early Assessment Program,\" Diorio said.\r\n\r\nJunior Michelle Leong is opting out of the test because she feels that it\u00a0would be a waste of time.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not want to take the Smarter Balanced test because I don\u2019t want to be at school for two days taking a test that seems irrelevant and not worth my time,\u201d Leong said.\r\n\r\nSenior Joseph Kao, who took the test last year, opted out after the first section of the exam.\r\n\r\n\"There was a section where they gave us two hours to finish a total of five questions, so it was kind of a waste of time,\u201d Kao said. \u201cIt was also a stressful period during junior year and I had a lot of work to do so I just decided to opt out.

[\/caption]\r\nThe Palo Alto High School baseball team (23-5-1, 12-2) defeated the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (20-12, 13-1), 3-2, thanks to a three-run rally in the final inning of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League championship game on Friday at Los Gatos.\r\n\r\nSophomore starting pitcher Jeremy Akioka held the Wildcats to just one run in five and one-third innings pitched, giving up his lone run in the third inning. Akioka said the team stayed strong despite trailing for most of the game.\r\n\r\n\"Our team did a great job of battling from behind and getting the hits when it mattered,\" Akioka said.\r\n\r\nDown 2-0, the Vikings were unable to score off Los Gatos' starting ace until the seventh and final inning where they sparked a three run rally.\r\n\r\nThis unlikely comeback started with a walk of senior Justin Hull, followed by a deep double off the right field wall by sophomore second baseman Max Jung-Goldberg. A pair of singles by seniors Alec Olmstead and Lawrence Han scored both Hull and Jung-Goldberg.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings finally took the lead off of a beautiful bunt by junior pinch-hitter Michael Champagne, which scored Olmstead from third.\r\n\r\nChampagne said the Vikings defense, specifically their pitching, enabled the offense to make a comeback late in the game and hopes the team can carry its momentum into the Central Coast Section playoffs.  \r\n\r\n\"Our pitching helped keep us in the game and we finally came alive in the 7th and had a great rally to take the lead,\" Champagne said. \"Niko Lillios provided a clutch closing inning to seal the victory. If our team can bottle that intensity we hope to have a far run in CCS.\"\r\n\r\nSophomore relief pitcher Niko Lillios sealed the game by forcing two flyouts and a strikeout.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will move on to compete in the CCS playoffs in the coming weeks The game time, opponent, and location have not yet been decided.\r\n\r\nAccording to Akioka, the team looks to continue its hot streak into the next round.\r\n\r\n\"We're confident that we will be able to use our momentum to push far through CCS this year,\" Akioka said.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School baseball team (23-5-1, 12-2) defeated the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (20-12, 13-1) 3-2, thanks to a three-run rally in the final inning of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League championship game on Friday at Los Gatos.","date":"2016-05-15 19:40:38","author":"Noah Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SCVAL-champs.jpg","categories":["Baseball","Sports","Spotlight","Uncategorized"],"tags":["Baseball","CCS","gatos","Jung-Goldberg","Lillios","niko","palo alto","rally","schoeben","scval","viking","win"]},{"id":119263,"title":"Coffee Chats: English teacher Mimi Park","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/12\/coffee-chats-english-teacher-mimi-park\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_119592\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"439\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13081997_1018696691539752_124260599_n.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-119592\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13081997_1018696691539752_124260599_n.jpg\" alt=\"English and Humanities teacher Mimi Park sits at her desk with an iced latte while discussing her career change. \" width=\"439\" height=\"439\" \/><\/a> English and Humanities teacher Mimi Park sits at her desk with an iced latte while discussing her transition from wanting to be a lawyer to becoming a teacher.

She teaches English 9 and English 9A, as well as Humanities. While Park loves teaching high school English, teaching was not her first passion.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI graduated from law school, but when I left law school I decided I really didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer,\u201d Park said. \u201cI really loved English, which was my major, but when I spoke with my professors a few years later and said 'I\u2019m thinking about becoming a professor,' they were like \u2018Don\u2019t do it! If you want to teach, go to public school, because there are no jobs in the humanities Ph.D. market.\u2019\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Park took her professor\u2019s advice and started looking at programs that would give her a teaching credential. She decided she wanted to move to California\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and ended up going to Stanford University's teacher education program.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen I started looking for jobs there was an opening here at Paly. It was part time and I was like, 'I can't do that because I have to pay rent,'\" Park said. \"Incredibly fortuitously, a teacher soon after took a leave for a year and there were enough classes open that I could get nearly a full-time position. I was hired at Paly and have been here for the past four years.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Park explains that one of the major differences between being a lawyer and teaching high schoolers is who you are working for.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was thinking of doing corporate law and my clients would have been gigantic corporations,\" Park said. \"I was so used to thinking about adults as my clients, and as a teacher, I had to readjust my thinking and start being more aware of the different issues surrounding public education, from the legal issues to policy to even the social-emotional aspects of the students.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the difficult transition from lawyer to high school teacher, Park says that being open to changing careers taught her how to relate to Paly students.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI would say my biggest piece of advice is don't pigeonhole yourself; be open to changing your path or looking for new opportunities, and don\u2019t be afraid to embrace them because it is really easy to get into the mindset of 'this is what I'm going to do and this is what I'm going to be,'\u201d Park said.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nPark recalls having spent all of her\u00a0high school and college\u00a0years preparing for pre-law. However, when she achieved her goal, she realized that being a lawyer just wasn't for her.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI planned to be a lawyer since 8th grade\u00a0when people told me I talk too much and therefore I should be a lawyer,\" Park said. \"It was the scariest and biggest decision I've probably made in my life so far, to give up three years of education and a lot of money and not have a plan,\" Park said. \"I had a year where I had to think about what I wanted to do. It's terrifying, but I think that being really open to that is a super important thing.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Park switching to teaching was the best decision she's ever made.\r\n\r\n\"I love teaching, and I\u2019m fortunate to be in a career when I\u2019m actually excited about coming to work and happy about the work I do, versus dreading the day ahead,\" Park said.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with English and Humanities teacher Mimi Park over an iced latte to discuss her transition from prospective lawyer to teacher, and her advice for Paly students.","date":"2016-05-12 21:08:12","author":"Daniella Maydan","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13081997_1018696691539752_124260599_n.jpg","categories":["Coffee chats","Features"],"tags":["coffeechats","english","Humanities","mimi park","palo alto","paly"]},{"id":120425,"title":"Liveblog: Baseball vs. Los Gatos in SCVAL elimination game","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/12\/liveblog-baseball-vs-los-gatos-in-scval-elimination-game\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_120116\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/baseball-beats-los-altos.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/baseball-beats-los-altos.jpg\" alt=\"Senior pitcher Alec Olmstead warms up with Senior catcher Lawrence Han before a regular season game against Los Gatos High School.
