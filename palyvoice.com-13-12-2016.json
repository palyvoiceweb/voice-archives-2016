[{"id":127245,"title":"Dear admin: Reduce stress, extend review days","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/12\/dear-admin-reduce-stress-extend-review-days\/","content":"Dear Palo Alto High School Administration,\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This weekend, libraries, coffee shops, and caf\u00e9s were flooded\u00a0with sleep-deprived high school students, their heaps of study materials and empty coffee cups engulfing tables and countertops. This is the universal indicator\u00a0that it is that time of year yet again: first semester final exams. It is no secret that the stress of finals places a heavy burden on the already overloaded shoulders of Paly students. Fortunately, you provided us with a precious 140 minutes of review per class on the Friday, Monday and Tuesday before finals. While we appreciate your efforts to reduce the stress on our strained student body, we are running into the same problem that we have with many\u00a0of your endeavors \u2014 it is simply not enough.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_127319\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"366\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/15388804_571942243011801_1270580781_o.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-127319\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/15388804_571942243011801_1270580781_o.jpg\" alt=\"Junior Chloe Iglehart studies diligently at a local Starbucks.

Photo by Maya Reuven.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During these three days of review, teachers are instructed to not\u00a0assign or collect any assignments, theoretically allowing students to have the time to review their seemingly endless pile of notes from the past semester. This is a daunting task, even with the extra time. However, this period is not nearly long enough for a student to study seven classes' worth of semester long material.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As any Paly student has realized, their finals studying must begin far before the school\u2019s allotted review days. Maybe this would be possible if the remainder of the week leading up to finals was\u00a0treated as a normal work week, as one may expect it to be. Instead, however, teachers use this time to wrap up all of their major assignments from the semester, leaving many students with an even more rigorous work load than any given week during the past four months. As a student, it\u2019s hard to worry about your math final in the same week that you have\u00a0two tests, three projects and two presentations.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what is the solution? <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We propose that next semester, you extend our review period\u00a0two extra block periods in total. This would give students that crucial study time necessary to excel in their finals, while only taking away a single class period from teachers, still allowing plenty of time to conclude their semester\u2019s material.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These extra two days of review would significantly decrease the stress of reviewing an entire semester of information in a period of three days. As expected, at the end of the semester, students are swamped\u00a0with last unit tests, projects and presentations that cause an unimaginable amount of stress as it is. Take our friend Marissa Ludwig for example, who had three tests in her hardest classes this week. \"Not only is that the first time I\u2019ve had more than two tests back to back, but it also prohibited me from being able to start studying for finals because I was worried about the unit tests,\" she told us, with exhaustion apparent in her tired eyes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unreasonable to expect that during this time students can begin reviewing independently. Instead, it exponentially increases the\u00a0pressure on them, as they take on the arduous task of cramming 18 weeks' worth of material into a measly\u00a0few days. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We do want to acknowledge the hard work of our teachers to schedule lessons for an immense amount of material in such a short span of time. This is why we believe that expanding our review period\u00a0a mere even \u2014 and \u2014 odd block day is the best\u00a0solution, and the most effective way to ensure that the needs of our student body are being met without shifting that pressure onto our staff. Teachers can certainly find a way to spread out that missing 90 minutes of instructional period throughout the semester. This minor adjustment on their part could make a major difference in our student body wellness, an issue that Paly has struggled with for years.<\/span>\r\n\r\nA second problem\u00a0presents itself for\u00a0classes that do not have final exams. For these teachers, extending the review period creates an array of difficulties, especially when it comes to keeping students engaged. For such classes, we are\u00a0more than willing to compromise. Those teachers\u00a0whose classes do not have a final exam of some sort may continue to assign classwork and homework as per usual, because if there is no special circumstance towards the end of the semester for their course, we see no reason why it\u00a0should not continue normally. However, we urge these instructors to bare in mind the work load that students are faced with in other courses, and make adjustments to their curriculum accordingly. The student body would be\u00a0placing a large amount of trust in these instructors to be flexible, which is critical to the success of this arrangement.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We asked Kathleen\u00a0Laurence, assistant principal of innovation and learning, why this extension\u00a0has not already been put into play. Her response ultimately came down to a\u00a0matter\u00a0of time. \"<\/span>The first semester is shorter than the second semester, so I think it would be difficult to extend it [the review days],\" she told us.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0However, again, we feel that two days is a minor concession, and we believe that many students would be willing to give up a day or two of their summer vacation if it meant having this major stress reliever come winter time. Laurence told us herself, \"That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be opened up for discussion. It just isn\u2019t currently on the [administration's] radar.\" Our hope is that this letter begins the process of opening\u00a0the\u00a0discussion, and sheds a light on an issue that students have been faced with for years.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know that you have done a lot to help decrease the stress of the students, from keeping the library open late, to giving students free dinners, to bringing in therapy dogs and we sincerely appreciate it all. However, when it comes down to it, our peers would reap the most benefits from an extra day of review in each class. This issue may not be one that is currently on the administration's radar, but something that causes a profound amount of stress certainly should be. We hope that you will take our concerns into consideration, and turn Paly's review period into one in which students can truly review. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Respectfully yours,<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maya and Maya<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"While we appreciate your efforts to reduce the stress on our strained community, we are running into the same problem as we have with all of your endeavors - it is simply not enough.\r\n","date":"2016-12-12 19:33:35","author":"Maya Reuven","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/15388804_571942243011801_1270580781_o.jpg","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":["finals","School","Stress","study","tests","winter"]},{"id":127353,"title":"Slideshow: girls&#8217; soccer dominates El Camino","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/11\/slideshow-girls-soccer-dominates-el-camino\/","content":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1K3UOMsmY4v3kEbxUZXXiU58CIXT-UUGaOKe-xIp8D-Y\/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"","date":"2016-12-11 22:54:49","author":"Ethan Kao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_7891.jpg","categories":["Sports","Uncategorized"],"tags":[]},{"id":127351,"title":"Meet the captains of winter athletics","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/11\/meet-the-captains-of-winter-athletics\/","content":"As Palo Alto High School's winter sports teams prepare for league play following the winter break, The Paly Voice sat down with the elected captains of this years girls' and boys' soccer, basketball and wrestling teams for exclusive information on their positions and outlooks for the upcoming season.
