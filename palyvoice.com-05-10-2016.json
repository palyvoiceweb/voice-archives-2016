The Madrigals enchanted the crowd with their extravagant clothing and marvelous tones. This performance also marked the beginning of the 50th year of the program.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Gala was such a mind-blowing experience,\" said senior member of the Madrigal program Joao-Gabriel Carvalho De Pina. \"To see all of the performing arts programs come together was amazing and unforgettable.

One is the School of Rock, which is a national after school program that allows teenagers to play rock music in a band and creates an open community for music lovers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Cohen participates in the Palo Alto program but there is also a program located in San Jose. He also has bands that are just for fun with friends, where they just relax and jam out without any stress or pressure.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cI think my favorite gig I\u2019ve ever played in was last summer when I threw a concert in my basement,\" Cohen said. \"A lot of people came.

There was a bit of <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/23\/the-problem-with-our-theme-selection-process\/\">controversy<\/a> over choosing boxing as the theme, as the class originally voted for a different idea.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Sabrina Hall, Spirit Week should be about class unity, not infighting.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that the people sort of forgot what Spirit Week is supposed to be about,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt's being united as one grade and all just enjoying this week as a sign of just love for the school and love for the class.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe members of the Class of 2019 are coming into Spirit Week with more confidence than last year and are planning to redeem themselves after coming last during their freshman year with the theme of \u201cfirefighters.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the theme is pretty nice,\" sophomore Paul Shand said. \"I think freshmen are going to come last, but I hope we do great.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe freshman class \u00a0will be kicking off its\u00a0first Spirit Week with the theme, \u201cEye of the Tiger.\u201d\r\n\r\nFreshman Sarah O\u2019Riordan is excited for the theme.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe freshman theme is so awesome this year,\u201d O'Riordan said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how everyone looks during Spirit Week.\u201d","excerpt":"Can the firefighting Class of 2019 extinguish the junior fighting spirit?

Each candidate hoped to distinguish him or herself from the group, discussing bold ideas while acknowledging problems\u00a0faced by the district. Read on to\u00a0take an in-depth look at\u00a0the various candidates and their platforms.<\/em>\r\n\r\nMelissa Baten Caswell, a current school board member, is running for her third term.\r\n\r\nCaswell has previously served as board president and has experience serving on various school specific PTA councils.\r\n\r\nAt the school board election forum on Sept. 20 at the Mitchell Park Community center, Caswell said she believes in\u00a0the importance of making sure all Palo Alto Unified School District students are lifelong learners with skills that are relevant in the current and future economy.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have to make sure every single student is engaged in the classroom and supported, in academics and social emotional health,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cPromote life long learners [that are] engaged in their education. We need to be looking at the whole child, looking at every single student.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, Caswell recounted the various improvements and new additions to curriculum that have taken place during her time on the school board. She noted that an area of improvement is allowing teachers to lead these breakthroughs by providing adequate resources and opportunities.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have added flipped classrooms, blended learning, pathways [and] we put in a program with 200 students doing research projects,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI do think one action is to help our teachers with innovative ideas and flushing them out. Give them some time. If we don't give teachers time to focus on innovative ideas they can't do it. Help teachers invest in choice.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nCaswell provided further explanations for her past stance against the opening of a new elementary school by noting the amount of classrooms that aren\u2019t used for core classes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere has been declining enrollment for 5-6 years, it's expensive to have a school,\u201d Caswell said. \u00a0\u201cTwenty six classrooms are not being used as primary classrooms in elementary schools.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She addressed student-teacher ratios by stating that its importance varies based on the type of class and the teaching style of the instructor.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe quality of the teacher preempts everything,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI think it would be a good idea for us to have ranges for class size. When we talk about averages it's across the school or department, I think putting hard caps would be difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caswell highlighted\u00a0that the district\u2019s previous homework policy should be reevaluated. As it is currently written the board has set a limit on the amount of hours a student should be spending per week on homework, however she stated that the policy isn\u2019t always applicable to all classes or students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe homework policy is really tough, I think we have some thinking to do about what really should be the policy,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI don't think a hard cap on minutes works in an environment where students complete work differently. Results have not been brought back to the board and It's hard for teachers to use the policy as it currently is.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental health and wellness has always been a vital topic in the Palo Alto community, and Caswell expressed her search for an improved system of assistance while acknowledging\u00a0the district\u2019s limitations.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur mission is education of our students and we will never be excellent mental health service providers,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI look for new models in our community, I am looking to Stanford and other experts. This is a regional issue, state issue and we should work together with our colleagues in the city and state wide.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nIn light of recent events at Palo Alto High School, student journalists brought to light questions regarding the behavioral conduct among students and teachers. Caswell repeatedly emphasized the importance of an accessible and understandable policy.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt [sexual assault] is incredibly serious and we need to make sure what policy is written down is clear and understandable,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cIf everyone understands expectations then it's clear when they've been crossed. It is important that our teachers can be supportive of our students.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nTake a look at an introduction to the other candidates and their stances on various issues currently faced by the community, as expressed during the\u00a0forum.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/school-board-candidates-vie-for-three-opening-seats\/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of all candidates<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/guide-to-school-board-elections-jay-blas-jacob-cabrera\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jay Blas Jacob Cabrera<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/22\/guide-to-school-board-elections-todd-collins\/\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Collins<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-jennifer-dibrienza\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer DiBrienza<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-heidi-emberling\/\" target=\"_blank\">Heidi Emberling<\/a><\/span>","excerpt":"Melissa Baten Caswell, a current school board member, is running for her third term.

He expressed the need for relevant life skills and aims to create an educational system that caters to the unique qualities of each individual student.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSchools should be cultural epicenters of innovation,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cWe should be empowering our youth, and getting youth engaged in society early, transforming the way they interact.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabrera\u2019s innovative ideas include integration between elementary and secondary\u00a0schools. In addition, he says he believes core class sizes ideally should not exceed 20 students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIntegration between elementary, middle and high schools of multiple different ages and types of education in the same space is healthy and a new dynamic,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cClass size matters a lot, it should be under 20 students. University style lectures in the high schools where they then break out into smaller groups could be effective.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though he said he wishes to reduce class sizes overall, Cabrera strayed\u00a0away from providing a hard cap on the number of students enrolled in a class.<\/span>\r\n\r\nOver the past few years student complaints have increased in regards to the amount of homework assigned at the secondary level. In addition parents and students have brought up the issue of \"test stacking\". Many students have multiple tests in core subjects on the same day and sitting through two or three consecutive 90 minute blocks of testing can be grueling.\r\n\r\nCabrera believes that to solve the homework and test staking problem in the school district, it is necessary to have at least one year of research and collection of data on the specific topics mentioned above.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I wouldn't be comfortable [discussing solutions] until talking to students and teachers,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cMy interaction with students has been that homework is increasing, and we should reduce in general the amount of homework for free time with families.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Cabrera, although mental health is one of the most prominent issues in the community, there is yet to be a solution.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe need to be preemptively active in solving our issues, we need to recognize that we don't have the solutions,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cThe real issues are the societal pressures.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nTake a look at an introduction to the other candidates and their stances on various issues currently faced by the community, as expressed during the\u00a0forum.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/school-board-candidates-vie-for-three-opening-seats\/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of all candidates<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/guide-to-school-board-elections-melissa-baten-caswell\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melissa Baten Caswell<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/22\/guide-to-school-board-elections-todd-collins\/\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Collins<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-jennifer-dibrienza\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer DiBrienza<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-heidi-emberling\/\" target=\"_blank\">Heidi Emberling<\/a><\/span>","excerpt":"Cabrera Jay Blas Jacob Cabrera, a community organizer, is one of five candidates for the upcoming school board election.

The five fastest runners from each team to cross the finish line receive the points that correspond to their place. The first place runner receives one point, the second place runner two, and so on.

Slaney broke a course record for a meet against Gunn, with a time of\u00a010:13 on a 2.2 mile course.

I'm also looking into recruitment options, and have been balancing running with academics.\"\r\n\r\nKent encourages everyone to give running a try.\r\n\r\n\"Running is something that when you put your effort into it, you enjoy it so much.
