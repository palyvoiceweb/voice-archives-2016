Photo by Ethan Kao.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 water polo team (8-8, 5-2) suffered a loss for the second time by the Gunn High School Titans this season (6-3, 6-0) this season by a score of 8-5 on Tuesday at Gunn.\r\n\r\nThis loss marks the second De Anza League loss for Paly, with both losses coming against Gunn. Although junior field player Jack Andersen and several senior field players gave their best efforts, the Vikings fell short to the overpowering Titans who led the Vikings for the majority of the game.\r\n\r\nAfter Andersen\u2019s first goal early in the game, the Titans scored four straight. However, the Vikings persevered and continued to battle for the entire length of the game, unlike their last match against Gunn, according to Paly senior field player Tommy Smale.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like losing to Gunn at all, but we have gotten better since the first game,\u201d Smale said. \u201cLast game, we died in the second quarter. But this time we fought to the fourth quarter.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough Anderson credited his goals to clear communication and constant activity, he said the team could have fared better in those key areas.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were on and off,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cWe scored when we had teamwork. Both of the times I scored, it was off drives created through my teammates moving. As a result, I could get open because the defense had to move, and I took advantage of that. We need to work on having that great movement throughout the entire game. We didn\u2019t have that movement the whole time, especially the third quarter.\u201d\r\n\r\nGoalkeeper Ben Rapperport also had his own perspective to offer on what type of improvements the team can make.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to consistently get back on defense and make our shots, and if we do that, we can limit the goals we let in and win our games against Gunn,\u201d Rapperport said.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Andersen\u2019s two goals, senior field players Alex Beaudry, Eric Maser and Andrew Jozefov each scored a goal, in that respective order.\r\n\r\nWith these improvements regarding team movement and defense, Andersen said the team can bounce back with a win.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will play their next game at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Saint Francis High School.","excerpt":"School boys\u2019 water polo team (8-8, 5-2) suffered a loss for the second time by the Gunn High School Titans this season (6-3, 6-0) this season by a score of 8-5 on Tuesday at Gunn.","date":"2016-10-05 18:22:26","author":"Sam Lee","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0027.jpg","categories":["Sports","water polo"],"tags":["ben rapperport","Boys","gunn","jack andersen","paly","rival","sports","Tommy Smale","vikings","water polo"]},{"id":123622,"title":"Walk and Roll Day in numbers","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/04\/walk-and-roll-day-in-numbers\/","content":"Palo Alto High School students show their support for going green this morning as they bike, rollerblade, skateboard and walk onto campus participating in the annual Walk &amp; Roll Day tradition.

Almost interactive, the choir groups moved into the isles of the theatre, and then proceeded to captivate the crowd with the hymn \u201cGloria.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The grand finale brought together all of the ensembles as members of choir, orchestra, jazz band and theatre were brought together to perform multiple songs and broadway numbers, most notably \u201cFor Good\u201d and \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d from the musical \"Wicked.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nPalo Alto native Rob Minkoff, director of \"The Lion King,\" introduced the final song, a Lion King Medley, which included the \u201cCircle of Life.\u201d As the crowd sang along, choir, orchestra, theater and band members provided the background vocals and music.

Each candidate hoped to distinguish him or herself from the group, discussing bold ideas while acknowledging problems\u00a0faced by the district. Read on to\u00a0take an in-depth look at\u00a0the various candidates and their platforms.<\/em>\r\n\r\nMelissa Baten Caswell, a current school board member, is running for her third term.\r\n\r\nCaswell has previously served as board president and has experience serving on various school specific PTA councils.\r\n\r\nAt the school board election forum on Sept. 20 at the Mitchell Park Community center, Caswell said she believes in\u00a0the importance of making sure all Palo Alto Unified School District students are lifelong learners with skills that are relevant in the current and future economy.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have to make sure every single student is engaged in the classroom and supported, in academics and social emotional health,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cPromote life long learners [that are] engaged in their education. We need to be looking at the whole child, looking at every single student.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, Caswell recounted the various improvements and new additions to curriculum that have taken place during her time on the school board. She noted that an area of improvement is allowing teachers to lead these breakthroughs by providing adequate resources and opportunities.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have added flipped classrooms, blended learning, pathways [and] we put in a program with 200 students doing research projects,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI do think one action is to help our teachers with innovative ideas and flushing them out. Give them some time. If we don't give teachers time to focus on innovative ideas they can't do it. Help teachers invest in choice.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nCaswell provided further explanations for her past stance against the opening of a new elementary school by noting the amount of classrooms that aren\u2019t used for core classes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere has been declining enrollment for 5-6 years, it's expensive to have a school,\u201d Caswell said. \u00a0\u201cTwenty six classrooms are not being used as primary classrooms in elementary schools.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She addressed student-teacher ratios by stating that its importance varies based on the type of class and the teaching style of the instructor.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe quality of the teacher preempts everything,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI think it would be a good idea for us to have ranges for class size. When we talk about averages it's across the school or department, I think putting hard caps would be difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caswell highlighted\u00a0that the district\u2019s previous homework policy should be reevaluated. As it is currently written the board has set a limit on the amount of hours a student should be spending per week on homework, however she stated that the policy isn\u2019t always applicable to all classes or students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe homework policy is really tough, I think we have some thinking to do about what really should be the policy,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI don't think a hard cap on minutes works in an environment where students complete work differently. Results have not been brought back to the board and It's hard for teachers to use the policy as it currently is.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental health and wellness has always been a vital topic in the Palo Alto community, and Caswell expressed her search for an improved system of assistance while acknowledging\u00a0the district\u2019s limitations.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur mission is education of our students and we will never be excellent mental health service providers,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI look for new models in our community, I am looking to Stanford and other experts. This is a regional issue, state issue and we should work together with our colleagues in the city and state wide.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nIn light of recent events at Palo Alto High School, student journalists brought to light questions regarding the behavioral conduct among students and teachers. Caswell repeatedly emphasized the importance of an accessible and understandable policy.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt [sexual assault] is incredibly serious and we need to make sure what policy is written down is clear and understandable,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cIf everyone understands expectations then it's clear when they've been crossed. It is important that our teachers can be supportive of our students.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nTake a look at an introduction to the other candidates and their stances on various issues currently faced by the community, as expressed during the\u00a0forum.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/school-board-candidates-vie-for-three-opening-seats\/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of all candidates<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/guide-to-school-board-elections-jay-blas-jacob-cabrera\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jay Blas Jacob Cabrera<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/22\/guide-to-school-board-elections-todd-collins\/\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Collins<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-jennifer-dibrienza\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer DiBrienza<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-heidi-emberling\/\" target=\"_blank\">Heidi Emberling<\/a><\/span>","excerpt":"Melissa Baten Caswell, a current school board member, is running for her third term.

In addition, he says he believes core class sizes ideally should not exceed 20 students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIntegration between elementary, middle and high schools of multiple different ages and types of education in the same space is healthy and a new dynamic,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cClass size matters a lot, it should be under 20 students. University style lectures in the high schools where they then break out into smaller groups could be effective.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though he said he wishes to reduce class sizes overall, Cabrera strayed\u00a0away from providing a hard cap on the number of students enrolled in a class.<\/span>\r\n\r\nOver the past few years student complaints have increased in regards to the amount of homework assigned at the secondary level. In addition parents and students have brought up the issue of \"test stacking\". Many students have multiple tests in core subjects on the same day and sitting through two or three consecutive 90 minute blocks of testing can be grueling.\r\n\r\nCabrera believes that to solve the homework and test staking problem in the school district, it is necessary to have at least one year of research and collection of data on the specific topics mentioned above.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I wouldn't be comfortable [discussing solutions] until talking to students and teachers,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cMy interaction with students has been that homework is increasing, and we should reduce in general the amount of homework for free time with families.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Cabrera, although mental health is one of the most prominent issues in the community, there is yet to be a solution.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe need to be preemptively active in solving our issues, we need to recognize that we don't have the solutions,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cThe real issues are the societal pressures.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nTake a look at an introduction to the other candidates and their stances on various issues currently faced by the community, as expressed during the\u00a0forum.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/school-board-candidates-vie-for-three-opening-seats\/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of all candidates<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/guide-to-school-board-elections-melissa-baten-caswell\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melissa Baten Caswell<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/22\/guide-to-school-board-elections-todd-collins\/\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Collins<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-jennifer-dibrienza\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer DiBrienza<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-heidi-emberling\/\" target=\"_blank\">Heidi Emberling<\/a><\/span>","excerpt":"Cabrera Jay Blas Jacob Cabrera, a community organizer, is one of five candidates for the upcoming school board election.

She has previously served as board president and is experienced in strategy, finance and high tech marketing.\r\n\r\nCollins and Dibrienza have experience working closely with the district, while Cabrera is a Gunn High School alumnus.\r\n\r\nCollins is a private investor and has served on the citizens\u2019 oversight committee of a school bond program and the school board\u2019s Enrollment Management Advisory Committee over the 2015-16\u00a0school year.\r\n\r\nDibrienza was a teacher and staff developer for primary education before switching to become an educational consultant and has served on Ohlone Elementary School\u2019s site council.\r\n\r\nCabrera, a community organizer, currently works as chief executive officer of Unity Network.

He hasn't looked back since.\r\n\r\n\"My parents did that first race with me, but after that I was on my own and just enjoyed running.\" Slaney said. \"I did it whenever I could.\"\r\n\r\nAs a freshman, Kent Slaney broke three season\u00a0records, landing him in the top 50 running times. As a sophomore, he broke two, and another in junior year at the Lowell invitational. If one were to look at his stats, they would see consistent broken personal records at nearly\u00a0every cross country meet.\r\n\r\nCross country has a unique point system. The five fastest runners from each team to cross the finish line receive the points that correspond to their place. The first place runner receives one point, the second place runner two, and so on. The team receiving the lowest score wins, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cougarsxc.com\/Info\/how_to_score_xc.html\">Capo Valley's Cross Country guide.<\/a>\r\n\r\nKent recounts the latest\u00a0invitational and remarks on the teams performance as a whole.\r\n\r\n\"So far it's been\u00a0pretty\u00a0spectacular, both as a team and individually,\" Slaney said. \"At [the] Lowell [Invitational] we did great as a team. We got 41 points, and the next best team got 91. Also, in our first scrimmage with Gunn [High School], I broke a course record by 11 seconds. Looks like it's going to be a really great season,\" Slaney said.\r\n\r\nEach meet has its own set of records from past competitors. Slaney broke a course record for a meet against Gunn, with a time of\u00a010:13 on a 2.2 mile course. Most recently, he has bested his past miles times with his new personal record of 4 minutes and 16.63 seconds, according to his\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.athletic.net\/CrossCountry\/Athlete.aspx?AID=6003909#\/L0\">CA Cross Country Profile.<\/a>\r\n\r\nBut Slaney is more than just a cross country star; he aspires to pursue a career in STEM.\r\n\r\n\"I want to major in computer science or electrical engineering,\" Slaney said. \"I enjoy programming a lot; I'd enjoy going into that field. I'm also looking into recruitment options, and have been balancing running with academics.\"\r\n\r\nKent encourages everyone to give running a try.\r\n\r\n\"Running is something that when you put your effort into it, you enjoy it so much. You go out with all the problems in the world, and come back and none of them will matter.\"","excerpt":"Imagine: A six-year-old Kent Slaney dashes through the Escondido Elementary School playground, leaving his playmates in the dust.
