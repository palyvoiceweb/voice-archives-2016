In the second event, groups of four students from each grade attempted to guess songs playing on a loudspeaker and run ran their answers\u00a0to the judges in the center of the football field.\r\n\r\nJuniors trounced the seniors in the first round of the ring toss, while the sophomores defeated the freshmen. The seniors then narrowly beat the freshmen in the final round of the ring toss to place 3rd, while the juniors defeated the sophomores and placed 1st in a tight race.\r\n\r\nSenior Fe Hmelar said she was disappointed with the outcome of the ring toss, but is confident that the seniors will come out on top in the end.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople tried their best and we still had a lot of fun in the stands,\u201d Hmelar said. \u201cI am confident that we will make a comeback tomorrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the event \u201cName that Tune,\u201d each grade energetically sent representatives running to the judges, the quick thinking juniors and sophomores came out on top.\r\n\r\nSophomore Zharit Brand says she hopes her grade can continue to perform well at rallies.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we did pretty well today but we need to be a little louder for sure,\u201d Brand said.\r\n\r\nSenior Dalia van Zyll, who competed in Name That Tune, says that is was difficult for the seniors to return at full force after the Night Rally last night.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were no communication issues, but we were just not able to write down the songs quickly enough,\u201d van Zyll said. \u201cWe knew all of the songs but one, we just couldn\u2019t get it down.\u201d\r\n\r\nVan Zyll remains confident that the seniors will win Spirit Week overall, but highlights the importance of unity between all grades.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to come back from out our losses today,\" van Zyll said. \"I think Spirit Week is about unity and having a good time so even if we can\u2019t win everything, I think in the end we\u2019re all winners.\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1erGiJw1Sgb05Dix8n3JMy_F2cA2PFWjd8wmx_PruQUo\/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"900\" height=\"629\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School sophomores and juniors are celebrating after success today in the lunchtime rally events.\r\n","date":"2016-10-20 19:49:43","author":"Emilia Diaz-Magaloni","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screen-Shot-2016-10-20-at-7.31.48-PM.png","categories":["News","Spirit Week 2016"],"tags":["fun","game","palo alto high school","paly","pool ring","rally","spirit","Thursday","week","wild thornberries"]},{"id":124726,"title":"Video: Night Rally thrills crowd with hamster balls, neon","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/20\/video-night-rally-thrills-crowd-with-hamster-balls-neon\/","content":"The Paly Voice documented Palo Alto High School\u2019s second annual Night Rally during Spirit Week 2016.

The Paly administration recently released a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1dgRurvVuzDXtwWqByW2LQgKYiFhHWuQ84r_lCxhSteY\/edit\">statement<\/a> reaffirming its current practice, stating that reporting weighted GPAs is not conducive to fostering a healthy school climate.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nAmid concerns from students and parents that this practice disadvantages students currently in the\u00a0college and merit scholarship application process, the Board decided to take up the issue for discussion earlier than the originally scheduled date in January.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PAUSD Supt.\u00a0Max McGee presented his\u00a0Two Point Plan for aligning the two high schools\u2019 grade reporting process, which stipulates that both schools would report only students\u2019 unweighted GPA on transcripts. In cases where colleges use weighted GPA as the criteria for merit scholarships, PAUSD would generate an official letter to the institution.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked by a Board trustee what the high schools would do in a situation in which a college would not accept a letter vouching for a student\u2019s weighted GPA, McGee responded by insisting that he would directly call the admissions department, eliciting an audible hiss from the audience.<\/span>\r\n\r\nOver 20 community members voiced their opinions on the issue during the Open Forum session, the overwhelming majority of whom argued in favor of reporting weighted GPAs. Paly senior Maya Katz, who pointed out to the Board at its meeting two weeks ago that not reporting weighted GPAs would disadvantage students for merit scholarships at certain colleges, most notably\u00a0the University of Oregon, urged the trustees to actively seek community input.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe need your [the Board\u2019s] support to get student voice and student opinion on the topic,\u201d Katz said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other student speakers echoed Katz\u2019s sentiments, emphasizing the need for administrators to listen to the student body. Gunn senior Asaf Katzir\u00a0spoke in defense of reporting weighted GPAs, explaining that he was depending on merit scholarships that consider weighted GPAs to help finance his college education. Parents underscored similar points in their addresses to the Board, with many saying that eliminating the option of reporting weighted GPAs constitutes a restriction on student freedom.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCan we just add a column with weighted GPAs [on the transcript]?\u201d Gunn parent David Hong implored the Board, drawing a rousing round of applause.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just four speakers, all of whom were Paly administrators, advocated for reporting only\u00a0unweighted GPAs. Paly principal Kim Diorio said she was surprised to see that no one from the Gunn administration attended the meeting to defend McGee\u2019s Two Point Plan, and that so many speakers decried eliminating weighted GPAs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI see this [standardized grade reporting practices] as an opportunity, but it sounds like it hasn\u2019t been framed that way with the Gunn students and parents,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cI hear a lot of fear and worry.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the Open Forum session, Board member\u00a0Camille Townsend argued forcefully in favor of reporting weighted GPAs, saying that it was \u201cterrible\u201d that students had to bring this issue to the board in the first place and that the district should not \u201cgerrymander the APs [Advanced Placement courses],\u201d by\u00a0failing to reflect\u00a0weighted classes in students' GPAs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While neither of them explicitly said no to reporting weighted GPAs, trustees\u00a0Ken Dauber and Terry Godfrey stressed the need to listen to professional educators in making the decision. Fellow Board member Melissa Baten Caswell expressed support for re-evaluating the grade reporting process such that weighted GPAs are included on student transcripts, but emphasized that the district must find a short-term solution for seniors who will be applying to colleges in the coming months.<\/span>","excerpt":"Emotions ran high at the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education meeting yesterday evening at the district office, where students, parents, school administrators and board trustees heatedly discussed the merits and disadvantages of including students\u2019 weighted grade-point-averages on transcripts for college applications.","date":"2016-10-19 23:15:25","author":"Dhara Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0979.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["college applications","gpa","gunn","paly","PAUSD","scholarships","School Board","unweighted","weighted"]},{"id":124630,"title":"Recap: Night Rally lights up Spirit Week Day Three","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/19\/recap-night-rally-lights-up-sprit-week-day-three\/","content":"Crowds were roaring as Spirit Week continued with the second annual Night Rally, which featured a neon color theme, with a Best Dressed competition, an intense six-station Relay Race and the Human-Sized Hamster Ball Race.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, the Wednesday of Spirit Week has been Color Day. However, due to the Practice Standardized Aptitude Test administered to the juniors this morning, there was no daytime Spirit Week rally. Instead, the Associated Student Body launched the Night Rally, where students wore neon class colors, with seniors wearing green, while\u00a0juniors wore yellow, sophomores dressed in red and freshmen decked out in orange.\r\n\r\nThe first event of the night was the highly contentious Relay Race. With 1,500 points on the line, the seniors pulled ahead at the last minute to win the event. The race was made up of six stations: the ball hop, army crawl, skin the snake, balloon pop, tarp carry and the exciting puzzle station, where\u00a0the seniors defeated the sophomores\u00a0in the final round.\r\n\r\nBy a random hat draw, the seniors and freshmen were chosen to compete first, with the seniors taking an early lead and quickly defeating the freshmen. In a tight race, the sophomores beat the juniors, sending the juniors to the consolation round, where the freshmen were victorious.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we did pretty [well], because we had a lot of spirit, and we tried our best,\u201d freshman Naomi Jecker said. \u201c[Beating the juniors] was pretty epic, and we are very proud.\"\r\n\r\nPaly\u2019s cheer and dance team both performed between the two activities.\r\n\r\nThis year, ASB\u00a0made some changes to the Human Sized Hamster Ball Race. Unlike last year\u2019s giant hamster ball, which only featured one person per class, this year\u2019s race included a handoff between two players after the first person reached the end zone.\r\n\r\nWith the juniors and seniors first up to race, the juniors pulled ahead at the last minute, while the freshmen barely edged out the sophomores in the last five yards. Despite falling out of the hamster ball, the senior class narrowly defeated the sophomores in the third round, but were unfortunately disqualified due to having two males compete rather than the required\u00a0male and female.\r\n\r\nAfter getting last place\u00a0in the Relay Race, the juniors redeemed themselves with a first place victory in the Hamster Ball.\r\n\r\n\u201cTonight was probably the best night that the Class of 2018 has ever had, we didn\u2019t start strong and it was easy to get discouraged, but we were still chanting and cheering louder than all the other grades,\u201d Junior Class President Jaiveer Sandhu said. \u201cThe pressure was on and [the hamster ball participants] got first place and they came up big for the grade when we needed it the most.\u201d\r\n\r\nTotal points will be posted on the ASB website later tonight.

The freshman theme is \"Babies,\" sophomores are \"Teeny Boppers,\" juniors will be \"Sophisticates\" and seniors will dress as\u00a0\"Senior Citizens.\"\r\n\r\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the seniors are in the lead followed by the juniors and sophomores. Despite a third place finish in tug of war, the freshman class remains in last place. However, it is still anyone's game.\r\n\r\nThe two activities at the lunch rally tomorrow will be \"Pool Rings\" and \"Name that Tune.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Pool Rings\" two members of each class, attempt to throw a pool ring around each others' necks. The point only counts if the ring stays around their neck. The two partners switch off, throwing the ring back and forth.\r\n\r\nNext will be \"Name that Tune.\" This competition requires four people from each grade to work together to name an unknown song played on the speakers.
