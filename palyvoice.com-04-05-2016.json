School and Gunn High School administrations will meet with a group of county health officials tomorrow to learn about the preliminary findings from the Epi-Aid investigation led by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Kim Diorio says she hopes the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/13\/county-to-begin-health-investigation\/\">CDC investigation<\/a> and health officials recognize that the community is heading in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would expect that [the CDC and county officials] would say that we are doing a lot of positive work in this area,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWhen I started my principalship three years ago, we weren\u2019t doing any of this and [now] we\u2019re working to strengthen the culture.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe information will be provided to the Palo Alto Unified School District through a series of committee meetings, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe [recommendations] will come in a series and provide us some information for next steps,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if there are any surprise findings or something that we\u2019re all missing.\u201d\r\n\r\nJonathan Frecceri, Paly\u2019s mental health and wellness coordinator, explained how one of the first initiatives in response to the suicide epidemic, Project Safety Net, will collaborate with the district to carry out the suggestions.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn advisory group of people is being put together with Project Safety Net to figure out how to distill this sort of information to the community and how to roll out the recommendations the CDC provides in the coming weeks,\u201d Frecceri said.\u201cThey were here for 10 days in late February collecting synthesized data from clusters dating back to the early 2000s and in 2009 the community pulled together and created Project Safety Net.\u201d\r\n\r\nProject Safety Net is a collaborative community network that formed in hopes of fostering youth well-being and implementing a mental health plan, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.psnpaloalto.com\/\">organization\u2019s website<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis collaborative consists of all the non-profit based organizations in Palo Alto, parents in the community, as well as students, including attendees at both Gunn and Paly,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cIt\u2019s really working to mitigate this phenomenon of youth suicide.\u201d\r\n\r\n<em>Additional reporting by Bianca Al-Shamari.<\/em>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School administrations will meet with a group of county health

We have diversified our economy. We are running surpluses.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Kasich, he was able to vastly improve Ohio\u2019s economy by cutting taxes, balancing the budget and using common sense. He says he plans to use similar methods to alleviate America\u2019s debt and increase prosperity.\r\n\r\nKasich also addressed his opponents\u2019 policies, implying that Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are threatening to divide the nation. He also stated that the Democratic candidates\u2019 economic promises are unrealistic.\r\n\r\n\"Here's what I tell young people: you can have all the free\u00a0you want but at the end of the day with the nation $30 trillion in debt, you might go to a free college but you won't be able to get a job,\" Kasich said.\r\n\r\nKasich\u2019s political viewpoints were woven into several anecdotes describing his early life growing up in a working class household in a Pittsburgh suburb and his encounters with prominent figures such as President Nixon and the president of his alma mater as a youth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever remember having met a Republican [in my hometown],\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI am a blue-collar son of a Democratic mailman. And thank goodness, because that has allowed me to be able to understand and relate to people at every level.\u201d\r\n\r\nCalifornia Assembly Republican leader Chad Mayes and California State Senator Jean Fuller were among several politicians who attended\u00a0the dinner to endorse Kasich.\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout question, John Kasich is the best candidate to have at the top of the Republican ballot,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cHe can launch the conservative reform efforts needed to restore our nation. He can unite the party and win the White House. He is prepared to be commander in chief on day one and he has the track record to prove it.\u201d\r\n\r\nFormer U.S. Senator Gordon Humphrey also attended the banquet to show his support for Kasich.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like the fact that he is superbly qualified by virtue of experience and success as governor of Ohio.\u201d Humphrey said. \u201cHe has a noble soul and a golden heart and is an extraordinary human being. I think he is well qualified for the office in terms of experience and also in terms of temperament. He is respectful towards others, unlike some of the other candidates who are most unpresidential.\u201d\r\n\r\nKasich is currently in third place in the Republican presidential primary with 153 delegates.
