The district has implemented numerous protocols aimed at responding to tragedy after previous suicide clusters\u00a0involving district students occurred in 2009-2015. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">District Supt. Max McGee sent a letter notifying parents of the incident\u00a0on Saturday, though at the time, details surrounding the death were unknown.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday morning, some teachers read aloud a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1_pSSub74GYZ6eT4Kql0Q3k0Oe0csPZ3F_0uklKRTG5s\/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">message from the administration<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to their first period classes, informing students that Sarah Longyear, a 2014 graduate of Gunn High School, had died by suicide. The message also directed students to various mental health\u00a0related\u00a0resources<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Additionally, Diorio sent teachers a link to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tXQB7Mu5_BM&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that provides guidelines for discussing mental wellbeing with adolescents.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Diorio, administrators were\u00a0unsure as to whether they wanted to prepare a standardized script for teachers to read off to students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe just thought, and given how connected our students are with Gunn, that we wanted to be on the same page as them,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIt\u2019s that balance \u2014 we don\u2019t want to ignore this, and act like it didn\u2019t happen, and at the same time, we have to be careful about how we message it.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the individual who died was an alumna rather than a current student, Diorio says district officials were more measured in their direct outreach to students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe wanted to see how yesterday would unfold, before checking in directly with kids,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe wanted to give them the opportunity to come to us on their own, if they need support. When it was our own student, or when it was a current Gunn student, we were much more specific in identifying kids we wanted to check in with. We took it more case by case, instead of doing a universal check-in.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diorio says that she hopes\u00a0the teachers who needed additional support talking to their classes could have received it. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think one thing maybe I would have done differently, if a teacher was in that situation, I would have seen if we could have partnered them with someone who could have been in the classroom and talked with the kids,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough time to put that plan together.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, Diorio\u00a0encourages students, parents and staff to be there for each other and be proactive in combating issues relating to mental health.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s keeping those conversations about mental health going, talking about it, noticing when people might be struggling,\u201d Diorio said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Santa Clara\u00a0County Public Health Department is scheduled to release on May 4 the preliminary findings of its <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/13\/county-to-begin-health-investigation\/\" target=\"_blank\">Epi-Aid project<\/a>, an investigation aimed at combating student suicides which began in February.\r\n\r\n<em>A list of school and community resources is available on the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paly.net\/crisis-resources\">Paly crisis resources page<\/a>.

Photo: Jianhao Meng.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing a three-year streak, the Palo Alto High School Science Olympiad Team placed second out of 28 teams at the North California Science Olympiad State competition on April 16, in Turlock.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team fell to Mira Loma High School from Sacramento by 27 points, according to sophomore Celine Wang, a\u00a0member of the green team, or varsity team. The SciOly competition is split into two teams: the green team, akin to a varsity team, and the white team, or the junior varsity team. Except for one year, Mira Loma has consistently won first at states since 2005, according\u00a0to their <a href=\"http:\/\/scioly.org\/wiki\/index.php\/Mira_Loma_High_School\">SciOly wiki page<\/a>. The only time this changed was in <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/05\/21\/paly-scioly-team-makes-impressive-debut-at-nationals\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2013<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when Paly beat Mira Loma and advanced to the Science Olympiad National Tournament and placed 16th. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/scioly.org\/wiki\/index.php\/Palo_Alto_High_School\">Paly SciOly's wiki page<\/a>, Paly has placed in the top three teams in States\u00a0since 2010.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMira Loma is an incredibly strong school,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIt is second in the nation as of last year. Considering we ended up pretty close to them is an achievement in itself.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Wang, the goal of teams at SciOly competitions is to get the lowest score possible, similar to golf. Higher-placing teams receive fewer points, while lower-placing teams successively receive higher scores. Competition events<span class=\"_5yl5\">\u00a0consist of testing, lab work and building, where teams build devices\u00a0before the competition which are then tested onsite. Events range from building a robot arm to <span class=\"_5yl5\">testing identities of unknown powders.<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough the team was somewhat disappointed that we were still stuck in a frustrating second place, we still improved from last year by three\u00a0points,\u201d sophomore green team member Chloe Hong said. \u201cIn fact, this is the smallest point gap between us and Mira Loma that we have had in all the years that we have placed second at States.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the frustration, the team did well overall and finished in the top five in many events, according to senior team captain James Wang.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEvent-wise, we did well across the board during States,\u201d James Wang said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s preparation for their tests and builds really showed during the awards ceremony. I believe we placed 5th or better in 19 out of the 23 events.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With many seniors leaving next year, some club members have voiced their anxiety about the team's future success, as Hong says that the green team will lose half of its members. SciOly adviser Ron Bowditch says he is not worried about filling the holes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have promising, bright and hard-working students coming up the ranks,\u201d Bowditch said. \u201cThe thing that is going to be different is that we are going to have a lot of students that are now on the Jordan SciOly team. Jordan did not have a SciOly team up until three years ago, so we will have a few students who were on the [Jordan SciOly] team before, giving them more experience with the competition.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to James Wang, the next step would be to find adult mentors who could help students study for their events.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere is a huge wealth of science expertise in Palo Alto that we have not really tapped [into] yet,\u201d James Wang said. \u201cI am sure that mentors would really speed up our studying and engineering processes.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nPaly's competitor, Mira Loma, has various\u00a0adult mentors that work with students one-on-one, according to Bowditch. However, he does not see Paly heading in that\u00a0direction.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI personally do not really like that idea,\u201d Bowditch said. \u201cI think the team should be completely student-run and student-focused; so when they win, it will be that much sweeter.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nMembers are excited for next season and for what it may hold.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"_5yl5\">\"I am really sad the season's over, especially since we'll be losing so many amazing seniors, but I cannot wait for the all the fun times next season,\" Celine Wang said.\r\n<\/span>","excerpt":"Continuing a three-year streak, the Palo Alto High School Science Olympiad Team placed second out of 28 teams at the North California Science Olympiad State competition on April 16, in Turlock.","date":"2016-04-25 21:27:08","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Scioly-States-story.jpeg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Bowditch","Celine Wang","chloe hong","competition","james wang","North California Science Olympiad Competition","paly scioly","science","scioly","states"]},{"id":119505,"title":"Fire alarms stall classes","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/22\/fire-alarms-stall-classes\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_119526\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Fire-alarm.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-119526\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Fire-alarm.jpg\" alt=\"Fire alarm\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/a> Students converge on the football field during the start of first period.

According to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson, construction workers in the Performing Arts Center accidentally triggered both alarms.\r\n\r\nThe first fire alarm went off before school started, forcing bewildered students to line up on the football field during the morning rain.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was raining outside and the construction workers didn\u2019t evacuate, so I was suspicious that a student pulled the alarm as a prank or to avoid their first period,\u201d junior Annabelle Hu said. \u201cI was pretty miserable in the rain. \u2026 It was a monumental waste of time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Gaby Pelayo was\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">recording a presentation in her third period Advanced Placement Spanish Language class when the fire alarm interrupted midway \u2014 ruining the recording. With the AP Spanish exam less than two weeks away, Pelayo\u00a0says she feels the alarm was untimely.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"We were in the middle of doing practice for AP Spanish test this coming May,\" Pelayo said.\u00a0\"It was a bit annoying as it disrupted our time in class and our practice. All fire alarms are a hassle but considering the [AP] tests are around the corner, our classes need to be as productive as possible.\"\r\n\r\nWhile today\u2019s alarms were accidental occurrences, Paly is not a new victim of false alarms.
