He hasn't looked back since.\r\n\r\n\"My parents did that first race with me, but after that I was on my own and just enjoyed running.\" Slaney said. \"I did it whenever I could.\"\r\n\r\nAs a freshman, Kent Slaney broke three season\u00a0records, landing him in the top 50 running times. As a sophomore, he broke two, and another in junior year at the Lowell invitational. If one were to look at his stats, they would see consistent broken personal records at nearly\u00a0every cross country meet.\r\n\r\nCross country has a unique point system. The five fastest runners from each team to cross the finish line receive the points that correspond to their place. The first place runner receives one point, the second place runner two, and so on. The team receiving the lowest score wins, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cougarsxc.com\/Info\/how_to_score_xc.html\">Capo Valley's Cross Country guide.<\/a>\r\n\r\nKent recounts the latest\u00a0invitational and remarks on the teams performance as a whole.\r\n\r\n\"So far it's been\u00a0pretty\u00a0spectacular, both as a team and individually,\" Slaney said. \"At [the] Lowell [Invitational] we did great as a team. We got 41 points, and the next best team got 91. Also, in our first scrimmage with Gunn [High School], I broke a course record by 11 seconds. Looks like it's going to be a really great season,\" Slaney said.\r\n\r\nEach meet has its own set of records from past competitors. Slaney broke a course record for a meet against Gunn, with a time of\u00a010:13 on a 2.2 mile course. Most recently, he has bested his past miles times with his new personal record of 4 minutes and 16.63 seconds, according to his\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.athletic.net\/CrossCountry\/Athlete.aspx?AID=6003909#\/L0\">CA Cross Country Profile.<\/a>\r\n\r\nBut Slaney is more than just a cross country star; he aspires to pursue a career in STEM.\r\n\r\n\"I want to major in computer science or electrical engineering,\" Slaney said. \"I enjoy programming a lot, I'd enjoy going into that field. I'm also looking into recruitment options, and have been balancing running with academics.\"\r\n\r\nKent encourages everyone to give running a try.\r\n\r\n\"Running is something that when you put your effort into it, you enjoy it so much.

Photo by: Daniella Maydan[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLast fall, I asked if I could pilot the use of MathXL in my Algebra 2, and by second semester, math teacher Natalie\u00a0Docktor and I were both interested in expanding the pilot to our IAC classes,\u201d May said. \u201cMathXL for School is now the official homework platform for all Algebra 2 and IAC classes this year. Ideally, students work the problems on paper, as they would if they copied the problems from the book. The difference is that they submit their answers online to check, rather than turn in the paper.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Docktor, students are given three tries to get a problem correct. There is also the option to use up one of their three tries to view the correct way to solve a problem. After each incorrect try, the program shows step-by-step instructions on how the student should have solved the problem.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While students must complete all of the assigned problems, they only have to get 80 percent of the questions correct for them to receive full credit for the assignment. Additionally, \u00a0If students receive less than 80 percent, they can choose to do additional problems until their percent accuracy rises to 80 percent, meaning that it is always possible for students to receive full credit on their homework assignments, according to May.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to May, a big advantage to completing homework through MathXL is that the program provides instant feedback.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTraditional homework is scored based on completeness and the accuracy of two problems, and the turnaround for feedback was about two class periods, on average,\u201d May said. \u201cUnlike traditionally scored homework assignments, each problem in MathXL is scored as it is submitted and feedback about errors is also given. Another pro is that it is directly correlated to the textbook,\u00a0and since it is produced by the textbook\u2019s publisher, the problems mirror the exercises in the book.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nJunior Alexander Juncosa appreciates the convenience of using MathXL instead of paper homework.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI like this a lot more because it is convenient that you can access your homework at any time or place, just as long as you have a computer,\" Juncosa said. \"This way, you can never lose your homework or forget it at home.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While junior Claire Lin prefers the on-paper homework to online homework, she appreciates the fact that MathXL provides students with example problems.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf I am stuck on a problem the program has similar example problems and they give you step-by-step instructions on how to solve them,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThe program\u2019s example problems are super helpful, especially if you aren\u2019t super strong on solving a particular type of problem.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite its upsides, May and many of the students favor certain aspects of the paper homework.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to May, the largest downside to MathXL is that there may be certain types of problems that are not given through MathXL. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNot every question in the textbook has an accompanying problem in the MathXL system, so some problems I may want to assign aren\u2019t available\u2014such problems would be used as warm-ups or in-class practice,\u201d May said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior Kelsey Lu finds that it is harder to learn when completing math problems online.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you are writing on paper, it enforces organization,\" Lu said. \"It really helps when you want to take a step back. So if you don\u2019t understand what you are doing wrong, writing your homework on paper allows you to go back and look at all of your steps to figure out where you went wrong. I also prefer it when a teacher checks over my work, because on MathXLForSchool you can do something wrong but still get the correct answer and then you will never find out that you didn\u2019t understand the concept.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being made an official part of the Algebra 2 and IAC curriculums, May says that the program\u2019s effect on student performance is not yet clear.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLooking at data from some chapter tests, there did not seem to be a significant difference in test scores for students who used the textbook versus those who used MathXL in the IAC classes,\u201d May said. \u201cHowever, I did see a significant difference in my Algebra 2 students\u2019 test scores. \u00a0However, another variable in that Algebra 2 difference was whether the students did homework, or not. We will be able to make comparisons of last year versus this year\u2019s test scores from Ch. 2 on up.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"Algebra 2 and Intro to Analysis and Calculus are officially introducing MathXLForSchool, an online math homework program, into their curriculum.

Some\u00a0sacrifice\u00a0their voices to scream cheers at lunchtime rallies, others spend countless hours in the auto shop perfecting their floats, and others wake up early every morning to make sure their outfit and face paint will secure their grade that\u00a0day\u2019s best-dressed points. Students with a vast variety of interests and talents all come together during this one week of the school year and unite\u00a0under one common goal: to prove their class is superior.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">The motto of Spirit Week is always to \u201cgo all out,\u201d but is there such a thing as going too far? Last\u00a0weekend\u2019s eruption on the Paly class of 2018 Facebook page surely proves so. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current junior class was filled with anticipation for this upcoming spirit week, following a narrow, yet disappointing, third place loss in 2015. Despite the placement, the class of 2018 gave an outstanding performance given their underclassman status, and look back on it positively.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_110599\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"506\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P5883.jpeg\"><img class=\" wp-image-110599\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P5883.jpeg\" alt=\"The class of 2018 shows off their float at the final rally of spirit week 2015.

Photo by Cooper Lou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many credited the theme, \"lifeguards,\" for the grade\u2019s success last year.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur theme played a huge role in our success last year,\u201d junior Chloe Iglehart said. \u201cMonday\u2019s [theme day] dress up was very consistent and you could tell what our theme was by looking at anyone in our grade. It really unified our class and brought a lot of enthusiasm to the rallies, dance, and float building.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one can imagine, when it came time to vote for the theme that could unify the grade yet again, many felt that it was a make-or-break decision for their chance at redemption during Spirit Week 2016. However, when the results of the final vote were posted, the outcome was anything but unification. Not only was the entire class divided, but many personally attacked other students, accused the Associated Student Body of rigging the vote, and put the success of the class on the line by threatening to withdraw their\u00a0participation. Supporters of the selected theme, the \"70s,\" were quick to reply with equally irrational responses. Within minutes, the class Facebook page exploded into chaos, intense battles in the comment sections, passive-aggressive posts, and innumerable notifications piling up on the lock screens of the junior class. In the end, ASB junior officers succumbed to the pressure and held a re-vote, which resulted in a change in the final theme from \"70s\" to \"boxing.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results of the original vote out of 138 students were 43% 70s, 34% boxing and 23% rockstars, according to Junior Class Vice President Marissa Ludwig. While no theme won by a landslide, it was not particularly close either. Issues were raised over how ASB officers publicized the votes, despite being announced on Facebook, Instagram, and Schoology, as well as in each theme meeting. Boxing won by a landslide in the second vote, which was out of 201 students, but many \"70s\" supporters were forced to surrender their opinions to settle the conflict.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actions taken by many students on both sides of the argument, myself included, were shameful. It was unfortunate to watch how such a passion for Spirit Week could transform into\u00a0something so\u00a0vicious, so quickly.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is obvious that none of the participating students intended for this to get out of hand as it did. Many acted out of character, driven only by their competitive spirit and their passion for the Paly tradition. However, no matter what the reason is, a vote is a vote. The majority selected a theme, and the class should have unified behind it.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of a democratic vote is to find and follow the decision of the majority, whether an individual agrees with it or not. For an event o<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n\u00a0the idea of coming together, threatening to ruin that unity over something as minute as a theme is unfair to the remainder of the class. Especially when that remainder is the majority. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vast number\u00a0of those speaking out on Facebook demanded a re-vote, but a silent majority voted for the winning theme. Both sides had representatives who were frustrated, angry and unafraid to speak their minds. I myself was conflicted on the solution. Should we undercut the significance of a democratic vote, to ensure that our grade be unified to maximize our shot at redemption? After sleeping on it, I feel the results from the original vote should have been upheld.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me make this clear, I did not come to this conclusion based on the fact that the theme of my choice won the original vote. My decision is based on the fact that I feel, through a re-vote, a majority of our class lost their voices. Simply because one is not outspoken, or willing to battle it out on social media to prove their point of view, should not make their opinion any less valuable than those who are. By allowing a re-vote after a decision had already been made, it sends a\u00a0message\u00a0that the loud and outgoing are valued over the quiet and shy, a common misconception in today's society. No matter the class officers\u2019 intentions, sadly, this is the result. Spirit Week is a week dominated by the outgoing extroverts, and one of the few ways that those who aren\u2019t comfortable dressing up crazy and screaming their lungs out can get involved is by voting for what the focus of their week will be. Unfortunately, now that has been taken away too.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nClass unity is by far the most important aspect of Spirit Week, and it is impossible for a class to be unified if the precedent is that half of the\u00a0students do not matter. In the end, we all understand that what makes a grade truly successful during Spirit Week is not a theme, but coming together. Fortunately, I have complete faith in the Class of 2018. We are a class full of passion, energy, and competitive spirit. While we are off to a bumpy start, our divided grade will soon put our disagreements behind us and join together once again. But what will happen for years to come?\r\n\r\nThis is certainly not the first time a class has\u00a0experienced such disorder surrounding a Spirit Week theme. The current senior class suffered a similar fate during Spirit Week 2014, after their preferred theme, USA, was shot down by administration. They quickly made the decision to adopt\u00a0a new theme, \"red card,\" which frustrated many.\u00a0The Class of 2018's recent outburst may\u00a0not simply have been due to a lack of maturity, but representative of a greater issue with Paly's\u00a0entire theme-selection process.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_77275\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"470\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/soph1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-77275\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/soph1.jpg\" alt=\"The class of 2017 dons soccer uniforms in honor of their theme &quot;red card&quot; during spirit week 2014.

Photo by Adele Bloch.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIt is only fair that the Spirit Week theme be decided by the students through a democratic vote to ensure that every student has an equal say in determining their theme. No one will be happy if administration is forced to make these critical decisions for us, but\u00a0if this method\u00a0of Athenian Democracy continues to fall, we may have no other choice.\r\n\r\nOur final option is to, rather than throw our entire system out, simply reform it. Currently, much of selection process is left up to class officers to organize, publicize, and enforce, independent of other grades. This freedom, while it may seem more convenient, complicates the process and creates\u00a0confusion and disorder among the students. Instead of allowing the continuation of this free-for-all in future years, we need to\u00a0standardize our theme selection process for all grades. Each year, freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors all\u00a0need to hold individual\u00a0in-person meetings to discuss ideas during the same week. This should be directly followed by an online poll, that will always take place the following day, and left up for 24 hours. This will minimize confusion about when the poll is up, and give everyone enough time to process the information and make a thoughtful\u00a0decision. This poll can then be followed up by a final vote of the same\u00a0structure between only the top themes, and once the results are in, the decision is final.\r\n\r\nResults of the final vote also need to be publicized. This will squash ridiculous assumptions that the vote was somehow rigged, and allow students to get a sense of where the majority of their class truly lies, instead of being overpowered by the stronger voices.\r\n\r\nFinally, the administration needs to be more vigilant about managing the reaction of students after the final vote. It is not okay to\u00a0react in such a destructive, hostile way, especially surrounding something meant to strengthen\u00a0class unity and cooperation. With more management by administration on this\u00a0controversial issue, students will be forced to communicate in a much more appropriate and construction manner. Administration should also be more clear with regards to which\u00a0themes meet their qualifications, which will avoid last minute chaos and further controversy.\r\n\r\nThese adjustments do not demand\u00a0any major change. They simply require a little more thought than we are currently putting into the process. We can\u00a0stop this cycle before\u00a0the Classes of 2019 and 2020 suffer similar fates to those of 2017 and 2018. Spirit Week is without a doubt one of the most positive high school experiences Paly has to offer, so let's stop marring it with controversy and disharmony, and make it just that much better.","excerpt":"The Class of 2018's recent outburst may not simply have been due to a lack of maturity, but representative of a greater issue with Paly's entire theme selection process.\r\n","date":"2016-09-23 17:38:15","author":"Maya Reuven","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P5883.jpeg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["2018","70s","ASB","boxing","disco","Facebook","juniors","lifegaurds","rockstar","spirit week 2016","unity"]}]
