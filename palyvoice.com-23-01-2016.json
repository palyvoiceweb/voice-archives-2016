He was 60.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to students, colleagues, and family, Scott was an optimistic, energetic man who always maintained a passion for teaching students in a classroom environment filled with infectious laugher. He cared for his students in a uniquely powerful way by celebrating each person as an individual.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"He was a really nice teacher who respected his students and treated them with patience and respect,\" junior Spencer Wycoff said. \"He was always with a smile and trying to make people happy in his class.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Mr. Scott's well-known and loved mantras,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u201ctrust and respect,\u201d emphasized his philosophy of care between students and their teachers. On campus, he could be found actively participating in staff and school-wide events, annually drawing repeated chants of \u201cMr. Scott!\u201d at the Staff Dance during Spirit Week. When he saw his students outside of the classroom, he never failed to greet them by name and give them a smile.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"I didn\u2019t think of him as a teacher, but a really close friend,\" senior Dami Bolarinwa said. \"He was someone who I could talk to about problems.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Paly Voice sat down and spoke\u00a0with one of his two daughters, Emily Scott, a special education instructional aide at Paly, about her father's\u00a0life growing up. Born on June 24, 1955, in San Jose, Mr. Scott\u2019s dream job as a child was to be president of the United States. Rather than sleeping with a pillow, he spent most nights with Jojo,<span style=\"color: #007f00;\">\u00a0<\/span>his beloved stuffed animal monkey, the younger Scott said, adding that she recalled that her father's family made an appearance on one of the early episodes of Family Feud; the Scott family was eliminated after his brother Jon Scott was unable to correctly identify a Jewish holiday.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Scott could be found during his childhood summers working at Bay Meadows, a horse racing track in San Mateo that closed in 2008. He graduated from Pioneer High School in San Jose before attending the University of California at Berkeley, where he majored in Earth Sciences. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those that were close to him, especially his high school students, know just how attached he was to exploring the outdoors and spreading awareness about environmental issues. He rode his bike to Paly every morning alongside hundreds of students, even during the rainy season when many students would catch a ride with their parents during a downpour. In class, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to put lessons on hold to discuss and monitor current environmental events going on at a local or even international level. He valued the importance of not just teaching his students about the environment, but encouraging them to apply classroom lessons to the real world. Many of his extra credit assignments involved researching newsworthy environmental topics or going to the Palo Alto Baylands to explore natural habitats.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"When we would go on trips he would always stop and look at rocks,\" Emily Scott recounted. \"He was very into rocks and fossils.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His first job teaching was at Charles Armstrong School in Belmont, a school for children with special needs, according to his daughter. It was during this time when he met his wife, Katherine, to whom he was married to for approximately 18 years until their divorce. Outside of teaching, he loved doing crossword puzzles, reading newspapers, discovering new music and playing games with his two daughters.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Paly, he taught a variety of subjects including physics, chemistry, and most notably, Advanced Placement Environmental Science, popularly for over 18 years, beginning in 1985. According to his daughter, he left Paly in 1991 to work for Apple in the technology industry before returning to the classroom in 2003. He supervised numerous clubs over the course of his time at Paly, and was the Paly Environmental Club adviser at the time of his passing. He also served as Paly\u2019s student activities director in the late 1980s.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss for our community and our school,\u201d Paly principal Kim Diorio said. \u201cHe was a great man, great teacher. I\u2019m personally going to miss him tremendously.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to his meaningful lessons in science, Mr. Scott will be widely remembered for his classroom traditions. On Friday afternoons, he would lead his classes in a \u201cTGIF\u201d chant to celebrate the beginning of the weekend. His most beloved teaching tradition is simply known as \u201cThe Clap.\u201d To begin class, he would stand up in the front of the room and start clapping in a rhythm that his students would soon replicate in unison. After a few rounds of clapping, he would welcome his class and begin doing what he did best, helping high school students become not just smarter thinkers, but better people.<\/span>\r\n\r\nHe is survived by his parents, Joan and Jerry Scott; sister Laurie Burmeister; brothers Joe and Jon Scott; daughters Emily and Elizabeth Scott; and his partner, Sara Tanous.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students and colleagues say it will be a long time before we come across another teacher who leads the clap, spreads environmental optimism and inspires students the way Mr.\u00a0Scott did.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"People loved him, and I don't think he will be forgotten,\" junior Emily Read said. \"[Principal] Kim Diorio came to visit our class, and she was in tears. She was crying so hard, and I could see the connection that he had made being here for so long. He impacted so many people.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1182669811\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Saturday\u2019s<\/span><\/span> celebration of life event for Mr. Scott, originally scheduled for the Quad but moved to the MAC out of concern for the weather, will begin at <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1182669812\"><span class=\"aQJ\">2 p.m.<\/span><\/span>\u00a0Attendees are encouraged to wear blue and gold clothing, the colors of his alma mater, UC Berkeley.<\/span>","excerpt":"Recently, Palo Alto High School lost one of its most beloved teachers, Kenyon Scott.

It\u2019s important because if flooding coincides with a Baylands supertide, flooding could be worse.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, families can gather supplies, according to Lee. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s better to have a plan and not need it,\u201d Lee said. \u201cPeople can prepare if they live in a flood zone by stocking on emergency supplies like flashlights, candles, bottled water, canned food for people and pets, other supplies like a wrench in case they need to turn off their gas and knowing how to turn it off.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other preparations include purchasing plastic tarps and sandbags, putting things high up off the ground, and arranging for pet care, according to Lee.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who are interested in either providing or seeking shelter can contact Lee at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:liz@funghi.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">liz@funghi.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"In light of the increase of rain that El Ni\u00f1o brings, a Palo Alto High School parent is aiming to provide shelter for Paly families at risk of flooding.","date":"2016-01-21 18:14:35","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/2.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["El nino","evacuation","flood","high school","palo alto","paly"]},{"id":114557,"title":"Teachers defeat students at Winter Rally","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/21\/teachers-defeat-students-at-winter-rally\/","content":"The teachers defeated the senior class at the first student vs. staff soccer game during the Winter Rally last week.

The office will train staff members on LGBTQ issues and provide case-specific assistance, according to Santa Clara County supervisor Ken Yeager.\r\n\r\nThe office employees\u00a0hope that the establishment of the office will inspire all counties\u00a0to\u00a0open similar offices, according to Yeager.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor many years, Santa Clara has been a leader in addressing the needs of underserved populations that require the services of the county,\u201d Yeager said. \u201cIt is my hope that by establishing the nations first county office dedicated to the needs of LGBTQ residents, Santa Clara County\u00a0will serve as an example for other counties looking to do the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn March 2015, Yeager sent a referral to the Board of Supervisors\u00a0for the creation of the LGBTQ office.\u00a0 The board approved the plan\u00a0and funded it later in the summer, officially establishing the office on Jan. 7, according to Yeager.\r\n\r\nAccording to Yeager, the office will be led by Martinez and management analyst Ashley Scarborough.\r\n\r\nMartinez is a director of the associated students at San Jose State University, while Scarborough works for the California STD and HIV Prevention Training Center in Oakland.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope to continue to serve as an advocate for community needs and a bridge to services,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAlso, I hope to support local leaders in creating programs, services and policies that create a just and welcoming community for all residents.\u201d\r\n\r\nCounty officials hope this opportunity will improve the lives of the LGBTQ community in Santa Clara County, according to Yeager.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn recent years, the county has created individual offices to serve women, veterans, racial and ethnic minorities and soon immigrants,\u201d Yeager said. \u201cBy focusing particular attention on these groups, we are able to better serve them. \u00a0It is my hope that this will be the case with the office of LGBTQ affairs.\u201d","excerpt":"Santa Clara County\u2019s Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Affairs office, the first county office in the nation, will be opening on Jan. 19 at the county government center.","date":"2016-01-19 21:02:29","author":"Zahra Muzaffar","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/2296055722_3ab87f0f1a1.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["bisexual","board","county","establishment","first office","gay","Ken Yeager","lesbiang","lgbtq","Maribel Martinez","office","questioning","santa clara","santa clara county","transgender"]},{"id":114404,"title":"Wrestling to compete at first home dual meet","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/19\/wrestling-to-compete-at-first-home-dual-meet\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_114527\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"558\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-19-at-9.12.25-AM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-114527\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-19-at-9.12.25-AM.png\" alt=\"Sophomore Calvin Grewal, freshman [[]], junior Seth Goyal and freshman [[]] pose for a picture after placing at the \" width=\"558\" height=\"429\" \/><\/a> Sophomore Calvin Grewal, freshman Andrew Wang, junior Seth Goyal and freshman Callum Day Ham pose for a picture after placing at the Bianchini Varsity Tournament.

According to head coach Don Briggs, this allowed him to change the lineup later in the game, when Paly was leading 3-0.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were able to possess the ball when we needed to,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cTen minutes into the second half, we started putting people in different positions. Doing that is actually good for them because it gives them the chance to work on different things.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings took advantage of their offensive opportunities much better than in previous matches, with goals by senior midfielder Cole Tierney, senior defender Cam Huard, senior forward Max Hallberg, senior midfielder Dami Bolarinwa and senior forward Ariya Momeny.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe got five goals and we capitalized on most of our opportunities, which is an improvement from our other games,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cI definitely have more confidence now and I think a lot of people do because there was a wealth of goals. That\u2019s always good to build confidence and have confidence in other people too.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Mountain View head coach Jim Mcguirk, the Spartans struggled to adjust their defensive strategy against Paly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDefensively, we\u2019ve played pretty good all year, but we didn\u2019t play as good today,\u201d Mcguirk said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t adjust to how fast they were. There were things we could\u2019ve done, like changed positioning to be in the right spots. We were in the spots that we\u2019re in against other teams, but we didn\u2019t adjust to their speed and get into different positions where we could handle their speed better.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings worked together more effectively in this game than they had in previous weeks, according to Bolarinwa.\r\n\r\n\"We moved the ball, got open, found the time to pass and hold the ball,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cIt was really good to see how our team is finally clicking together.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly will play Fremont High School (2-4-3, 1-1-1) at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday at Fremont.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' soccer team (8-0-1, 4-0) dominated the Mountain View High School Spartans (5-2-4, 0-1-1) on Friday at the Paly soccer field by a score of 5-0.","date":"2016-01-18 22:38:20","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_7965.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap"],"tags":["ariya momeny","boys soccer","cam huard","cole tierney","dami bolarinwa","don briggs","jim mcguirk","max hallberg","mountain view","palo alto high school","roberto sotelo","Soccer","spartans","vikings"]}]
