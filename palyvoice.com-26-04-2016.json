The team won multiple individual medals in multiple events, giving them a 78 point lead in front ofthem and the third place team. \"I am extremely proud of our team and what we were able to accomplish,\" said sophomore green team member, Celine Wang.

The SciOly competition is split into two teams: the green team, akin to a varsity team, and the white team, or the junior varsity team. Except for one year, Mira Loma has consistently won first at states since 2005, according\u00a0to their <a href=\"http:\/\/scioly.org\/wiki\/index.php\/Mira_Loma_High_School\">SciOly wiki page<\/a>. The only time this changed was in <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/05\/21\/paly-scioly-team-makes-impressive-debut-at-nationals\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2013<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when Paly beat Mira Loma and advanced to the Science Olympiad National Tournament and placed 16th. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/scioly.org\/wiki\/index.php\/Palo_Alto_High_School\">Paly SciOly's wiki page<\/a>, Paly has placed in the top three teams in States\u00a0since 2010.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMira Loma is an incredibly strong school,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIt is second in the nation as of last year. Considering we ended up pretty close to them is an achievement in itself.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Wang, the goal of teams at SciOly competitions is to get the lowest score possible, similar to golf. Higher-placing teams receive fewer points, while lower-placing teams successively receive higher scores. Competition events<span class=\"_5yl5\">\u00a0consist of testing, lab work and building, where teams build devices\u00a0before the competition which are then tested onsite. Events range from building a robot arm to <span class=\"_5yl5\">testing identities of unknown powders.<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough the team was somewhat disappointed that we were still stuck in a frustrating second place, we still improved from last year by three\u00a0points,\u201d sophomore green team member Chloe Hong said. \u201cIn fact, this is the smallest point gap between us and Mira Loma that we have had in all the years that we have placed second at States.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the frustration, the team did well overall and finished in the top five in many events, according to senior team captain James Wang.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEvent-wise, we did well across the board during States,\u201d James Wang said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s preparation for their tests and builds really showed during the awards ceremony. I believe we placed 5th or better in 19 out of the 23 events.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With many seniors leaving next year, some club members have voiced their anxiety about the team's future success, as Hong says that the green team will lose half of its members. SciOly adviser Ron Bowditch says he is not worried about filling the holes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have promising, bright and hard-working students coming up the ranks,\u201d Bowditch said. \u201cThe thing that is going to be different is that we are going to have a lot of students that are now on the Jordan SciOly team. Jordan did not have a SciOly team up until three years ago, so we will have a few students who were on the [Jordan SciOly] team before, giving them more experience with the competition.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to James Wang, the next step would be to find adult mentors who could help students study for their events.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere is a huge wealth of science expertise in Palo Alto that we have not really tapped [into] yet,\u201d James Wang said. \u201cI am sure that mentors would really speed up our studying and engineering processes.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nPaly's competitor, Mira Loma, has various\u00a0adult mentors that work with students one-on-one, according to Bowditch. However, he does not see Paly heading in that\u00a0direction.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI personally do not really like that idea,\u201d Bowditch said. \u201cI think the team should be completely student-run and student-focused; so when they win, it will be that much sweeter.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nMembers are excited for next season and for what it may hold.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"_5yl5\">\"I am really sad the season's over, especially since we'll be losing so many amazing seniors, but I cannot wait for the all the fun times next season,\" Celine Wang said.\r\n<\/span>","excerpt":"Continuing a three-year streak, the Palo Alto High School Science Olympiad Team placed second out of 28 teams at the North California Science Olympiad State competition on April 16, in Turlock.","date":"2016-04-25 21:27:08","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Scioly-States-story.jpeg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Bowditch","Celine Wang","chloe hong","competition","james wang","North California Science Olympiad Competition","paly scioly","science","scioly","states"]},{"id":119505,"title":"Fire alarms stall classes","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/22\/fire-alarms-stall-classes\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_119526\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Fire-alarm.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-119526\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Fire-alarm.jpg\" alt=\"Fire alarm\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/a> Students converge on the football field during the start of first period.

According to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson, construction workers in the Performing Arts Center accidentally triggered both alarms.\r\n\r\nThe first fire alarm went off before school started, forcing bewildered students to line up on the football field during the morning rain.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was raining outside and the construction workers didn\u2019t evacuate, so I was suspicious that a student pulled the alarm as a prank or to avoid their first period,\u201d junior Annabelle Hu said. \u201cI was pretty miserable in the rain. \u2026 It was a monumental waste of time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Gaby Pelayo was\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">recording a presentation in her third period Advanced Placement Spanish Language class when the fire alarm interrupted midway \u2014 ruining the recording.

All fire alarms are a hassle but considering the [AP] tests are around the corner, our classes need to be as productive as possible.\"\r\n\r\nWhile today\u2019s alarms were accidental occurrences, Paly is not a new victim of false alarms.

I\u2019m so glad I get to be a part of it.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School junior Nadia Leinhos will speak at the California Senate tomorrow to defend a bill which would require theater and dance teachers to obtain teaching credentials in their respective subject areas.","date":"2016-04-19 19:24:16","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13059436_1696364990623528_1698417690_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["916","arts","bill","California","dance","leinhos","nadia","paly","pe","senate","theater"]},{"id":119306,"title":"Storify: Prom 2016","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/19\/storify-prom-2016\/","content":"Look back at Palo Alto High School's Prom 2016 on Saturday\u00a0at the San Francisco Design Center\u00a0as seen through\u00a0various social media posts using the hashtag #palyprom.\r\n<div class=\"storify\">\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/storify.com\/thepalyvoice\/prom-2016\/embed?border=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"750\" frameborder=\"no\"><\/iframe><script src=\"\/\/storify.com\/thepalyvoice\/prom-2016.js?border=false\"><\/script><noscript>[&amp;lt;a href=\"\/\/storify.com\/thepalyvoice\/prom-2016\" target=\"_blank\"&amp;gt;View the story \"Prom 2016\" on Storify&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;]<\/noscript>\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Look back at Palo Alto High School's Prom 2016 on Saturday at the San Francisco Design Center as seen through various social media posts using the hashtag #palyprom.\r\n","date":"2016-04-19 18:57:08","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13035444_1767273386836890_735391528_o.jpg","categories":["Multimedia","Spotlight"],"tags":["#palyprom","paly prom","prom","prom 2016","san francisco design center"]},{"id":119401,"title":"Advisory this week is for all freshman and juniors","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/19\/advisory-this-week-is-for-all-freshman-and-juniors\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-04-19 13:45:11","author":"Chirag Akella","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":119322,"title":"Campus defaced with racist, pro-Trump graffiti","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/18\/campus-defaced-with-racist-pro-trump-graffiti\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_119339\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"341\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13046219_1718988074981178_1740350271_n1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-119339\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13046219_1718988074981178_1740350271_n1.jpg\" alt=\"13046219_1718988074981178_1740350271_n\" width=\"341\" height=\"255\" \/><\/a> The custodial staff discovered graffiti on a bench near the science building at Palo Alto High School this morning.

We clean it up right away, so the person responsible doesn't get the attention they want.\"\r\n\r\nAccording\u00a0to Berkson, the\u00a0Palo Alto Police Department\u00a0has been contacted to aid in the investigation.\r\n\r\nIn an email to The Paly Voice, Supt. Max McGee stated that\u00a0he encourages students to stand against bigotry.\r\n\r\n\"Hate speech is a serious matter, and those who defaced our campus will suffer serious consequences,\" McGee said. \"We are immediately removing the graffiti, but more importantly, I trust that our Paly students will not tolerate any expression of racial, ethnic or gender disparagement and will take positive steps to assure that our campus is kind, safe and welcoming for every individual.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_119340\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"254\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13059324_1718987974981188_33468229_n1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-119340\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13059324_1718987974981188_33468229_n1.jpg\" alt=\"13059324_1718987974981188_33468229_n\" width=\"254\" height=\"339\" \/><\/a> The boys' restroom in the 800 building was one of several locations on campus vandalized with a pro-Trump message. Administration covered up \"Black Lives Suck\" underneath a piece of paper, according to secretary Carolyn Benfield.

The person who did it clearly doesn't understand the hate that they're projecting and what damage they can do.\"\r\n\r\nThe graffiti appeared just as\u00a0Paly began its <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/17\/change-in-our-schools-week-cultivating-a-positive-community\/\">first annual Change In Our Schools Week<\/a>, intended\u00a0to celebrate student diversity and promote respect. Junior Cezanne Lane, an organizer of CIOS Week and Associated Student Body spirit commissioner,\u00a0was also\u00a0taken aback by the hateful comments.\r\n\r\n\"This is really shocking for a community that I thought was so progressive,\" Lane said. \"Hopefully the person who did it didn't mean it, but those words are harmful.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Dami Bolarinwa said he is disappointed by the graffiti. According to Bolarinwa, the Black Lives Matter movement carries an important message that people need to hear.\r\n\r\n\"That's truly heartbreaking to see that people have reverted to such disgrace of integrity,\" Bolarinwa said. \"Black lives and many minority lives are targeted, so it saddens me to know students at Paly feel that way and are continuing to target students on campus with vandalism as this.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Sergio Valente said he believes the messages do not represent the values of the Paly student body.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I saw the graffiti I assumed that the people who created it were just doing so as a joke and thought it was funny,\u201d Valente said. \u201cI think there are many better ways to express juvenile fun and it\u2019s sad that they chose to do so in a way that can be offensive. I also don\u2019t think that it is something that needs to be blown out of proportion as it was the actions of presumably a few individuals and need not reflect on the school as a whole.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Maya Lathi said she thinks that people have the right to express political opinions, but personal beliefs should be shared in ways other than graffiti.\r\n\r\n\"With regards to the 'Black Lives Suck' graffiti, I think it is sad to see that this is a view a fellow student has, but it shouldn't be considered representative of our tolerant student body,\" Lathi said.\u00a0\"In regards to the 'Trump 1237' graffiti, while I disagree with the politics of Donald Trump, I respect each citizen's right to believe in whatever politics they'd like to.\u00a0There are more respectful, less destructive, ways to express one's opinion than vandalism.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Reuben Kramer said he hopes people learn to value respect\u00a0and tolerance.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I think that it's embarrassing that someone would do a hate crime, especially on campus,\" Kramer said. \"I would encourage people to stand up to racism whenever they see it, because it has no place in this world.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nTrump\u00a0is scheduled to appear at the California Republican Party convention on Friday, April 29, in Burlingame. A protest to his speech is being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1524102991231738\/\" target=\"_blank\">organized through Facebook<\/a>, encouraging people to \"show him [Trump] a real Bay Area welcome by peacefully protesting outside.\" Several Paly students marked that they are planning to attend the protest.\u00a0The Trump\u00a0campaign, when contacted by The Paly Voice, indicated it would respond to news of the graffiti but had not done so as of 9:45 p.m. Monday\u00a0night.\r\n\r\nComparable graffiti has defaced other schools outside of Palo Alto, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/local\/education\/higher-ed\/la-me-ln-lmu-graffiti-20160406-story.html\">Loyola Marymount University<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/politics-government\/ci_29675931\/trump-graffiti-scares-emory-students-we-are-pain\">Emory University<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonherald.com\/news\/local_coverage\/2016\/03\/judge_s_son_charged_with_spray_painting_trump_and_racist_graffiti\">Northwestern University,\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dispatch.com\/content\/stories\/local\/2016\/04\/16\/pro-trump-message-on-wall-sparks-discourse-at-ou.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ohio University<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/laist.com\/2016\/03\/14\/pacific_palisades_racist_graffiti.php\">Pacific Palisades Charter High School<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<em>Additional reporting and writing by Emily Hwang.<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Editor\u2019s Note: For a few minutes, an extension on one of our editors' browser changed all mentions of \u201cTrump\u201d to \u201cDrumpf.\u201d We apologize\u00a0for this brief departure from correct spelling.<\/em>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School administration is investigating racist and pro-Donald Trump graffiti messages discovered on campus this morning.","date":"2016-04-18 21:48:09","author":"Bianca Al-Shamari","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/trump-graffiti.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["graffiti","messages","racist","Trump","vandalism"]}]
