She wanted it so she went and got that ball and put it in. That was all on her own her effort.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings overall played very consistently, with eight points in the first quarter, 10 in both of the second and third and 12 in the fourth.\r\n\r\nA key aspect to winning the game was the pressure defense, according to Peters.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe put a lot of pressure, made them run around a lot and work for their scores,\u201d Peters said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings were able to hold the Titans to 10 points or less each quarter.\r\n\r\nDespite the low scoring, the Vikings\u2019 defense was vital to the victory, junior forward Julie Chandler said.\r\n\r\n\u201cOverall I think we played fairly well,\" Chandler said. \"We played good defense and played hard the whole game. Our offense wasn't at its best, but we were able to fight through and pull out the win.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe win against Gunn was also special for the players, especially for the seniors, according to Chandler.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlaying against Gunn is always our most exciting game and beating them is a great feeling, no matter what the score is,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cThis being the last Gunn game for our seniors made us want to win even more.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenior forward Courtney Lovely shared Chandler's enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe win was amazing and a great way to start the second half of the season,\u201d Lovely said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings hope to extend their winning streak to four at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Gunn against Saratoga High School (12-7, 3-4), who they lost to back in January.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 basketball team (12-6, 5-2) stretched its win streak to three after routing crosstown rival Gunn High School (11-7, 2-5) 40-26 on Friday night at Gunn.","date":"2016-02-01 22:18:59","author":"Sam Lee","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/julie-jumpman.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["alexis harris","basketball","defense","girls","gunn","hoops","julie chandler","lauren koyama","Quad Night","scott peters","sports","titans","victory","vikings","win"]},{"id":115314,"title":"Fire alarm caused by science class demonstration","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/01\/fire-alarm-caused-by-science-class-demonstration\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115316\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"341\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_72081.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-115316\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_72081.jpg\" alt=\"Chemistry teacher Ron Bowditch holds up a small strip of magnesium, similar to the one ignited today during 7th period that caused the fire alarm to go off.

We called maintenance just to let them know what happened, and if there is something to look into, they will look into it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Bowditch, he had been performing a simple experiment, in which a small strip of magnesium is set on fire so students can observe a reaction, a demonstration he says he has performed many times in the past.\r\n\r\n\"That little tiny piece of magnesium set off the alarm, which we have ignited many times in this class,\" Bowditch said. \"I\u2019m not sure how it set it off, but it did. I knew it was me because the second I lit it, the fire alarm went off.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents evacuated from their\u00a0classrooms to the football field in the middle of 7th period, disrupting class lessons, tests and other activities. Junior Jackson Kienitz is\u00a0one of many students to have class plans delayed due to the fire alarm, though the activity was not pertinent to his learning.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was in theater class when the fire alarm went off, and we were supposed to be performing graded scenes,\u201d Kienitz said. \u201cHowever, with the alarm, we weren\u2019t able to perform all the scenes, forcing us to reschedule class activities.

On the day of tryouts, athletes will hand the Health Clearance Card to their coaches.\r\n\r\nWhile the application process remains mostly the same, the only change is the new method for coaches to verify that an athlete is cleared to participate, even during tryouts.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt puts coaches in a tough position when the student would say \u2018I am getting it [my physical clearance] tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018I uploaded it to Appryse, I don\u2019t know why you can\u2019t see it,\u2019\u201d Bowers said. \u201cCoaches were having to spend too much time dealing with the physicals instead of working with their athletes, so what would happen is that some coaches would not take the time to verify that the student was cleared to participate.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents may pick up the Health Clearance Card in person on Friday from 2 to 4 p.m., and\u00a0on Monday\u00a0from 11:30 to 4 p.m. in Room 725.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School athletes are required to complete a new athletic clearance process for the spring season in an effort to better verify a student's eligibility to play a sport.","date":"2016-01-28 22:22:56","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/DSCN3235.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["appryse","bowers","card","clearance","kathi","new","physical","requirement","sports","spring"]},{"id":115117,"title":"Newseum CEO to discuss freedom of expression at MAC","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/28\/newseum-ceo-to-discuss-freedom-of-expression-at-mac\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115118\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"466\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/mac.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-115118\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/mac.jpg\" alt=\"The school\u2019s Media Arts Center will host Newseum CEO, Jeffery Herbst as part of the Media Arts Center\u2019s Speaker Series.\u201cThere will be two more later this spring,\u201d Event Organizer and Palo Alto High School Journalism teacher Esther Wojcicki said.
