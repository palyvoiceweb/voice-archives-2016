The app was developed by Stanford University's Transformative Learning Technologies Lab in conjunction with the Paly journalism program.\r\n\r\nAccording to a press release from study leader Chris Proctor, the app will allow students to contribute to a student-only online forum where articles from The Paly Voice, Verde Magazine, Viking Magazine and The Campanile\u00a0can\u00a0be discussed.\r\n\r\nProctor, a former Paly English teacher and current PhD student in education at Stanford, says that the app will be part of a field study, and that the app will be donated to the Paly journalism program\u00a0if it is found successful.\r\n\r\n\"The field trial will run through winter break; during this time we hope to gain a large base of users reading Paly journalism content on the app and discussing the stories through comments,\" Proctor said.\r\n\r\nProctor worked on developing the\u00a0app with Paly seniors Daniel Li and Adrienne Kwok and juniors\u00a0Norman Karr, Saurin Holdheim, Julia Qiao and Stephanie Lee. Journalism advisers Paul Kandell and Esther Wojcicki provided additional support.\r\n\r\n\"I chose to get involved because I was interested in helping to develop a real app,\" Karr said. \"It was pretty cool as it brought together all the Paly Publications [that gave permission] into one place.\"\r\n\r\nThe development of the app was fueled by a Stanford research study on schools' relations to their \"digital campuses,\" according to the press release. The release statement adds that while these spaces are important for learning and allowing students to express their own opinions, they are often discouraged by schools as they are feared as distractions from learning in the classroom.\r\n\r\n\"My hypothesis is that supporting powerful student identities in those spaces will be one way schools can structure them as safe and effective spaces for learning,\" Proctor said. \"I see\u00a0Paly's student\u00a0journalism program as potentially an excellent example of this dynamic; the app is designed to increase the impact\u00a0of Paly's student journalism on the school community by increasing readership and reader engagement.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Students are now able to download a new Palo Alto High School journalism iOS application released Monday called \"Paly Journalism\".

In order to adapt we need to work hard for every rebound and bring the energy that our seniors last year brought [to] every game,\" Burris said.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Harris will have the largest impact on the team, as she led the team in both scoring and rebounding last year, according to Maxpreps.\r\n\r\n\"We have a lot of guards who are capable of making threes, which can make up for the loss of our post scoring.\" junior guard Carly Leong said. \"We need to be more physical when it comes to rebounding, because we are a smaller team, and physicality will make up for it.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the loss, the girls team \u00a0maintain their dominance, having eight of the eleven players returning to the team.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only major change to the program is how many new players we're bringing in.
