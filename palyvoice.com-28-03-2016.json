In addition, over 500 students participated in on-campus activities on the Quad during lunch.\r\n\r\nGet Involved Palo Alto coordinated the on-campus events while Paly\u00a0Youth Community Service Club\u00a0organized the off-campus events, contacted service sites and streamlined student participation, according to YCS Co-President junior Ibby Day.\r\n\r\nService Day featured 20 on-campus booths aimed at promoting volunteerism through small actions, including crafting bookmarks and picking up litter on campus to provide a range of opportunities for those who were unable to travel off campus. As part of the main on-campus service projects, students sewed and tie-dyed bags for The Little Red Shoes Program.\r\n\r\n\u201cVolunteerism is the type of thing that is missing in a lot of students' lives,\u201d Wang said. \u201cPeople become really busy and forget about giving back, but that's what Service Day is all about. It's about reminding people of all the good that we do.\u201d\r\n\r\n<em>Photos by Adrienne Kwok.<\/em>\r\n<div id=\"cp_widget_cbcebe21-c07e-4dfb-a97c-d01c155db91a\">\r\n\r\n...<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\/\/ <![CDATA[\r\nvar cpo = []; cpo[\"_object\"] =\"cp_widget_cbcebe21-c07e-4dfb-a97c-d01c155db91a\"; cpo[\"_fid\"] = \"AQCAAUdV_H8T\"; var _cpmp = _cpmp || []; _cpmp.push(cpo); (function() { var cp = document.createElement(\"script\"); cp.type = \"text\/javascript\"; cp.async = true; cp.src = \"\/\/www.cincopa.com\/media-platform\/runtime\/libasync.js\"; var c = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; c.parentNode.insertBefore(cp, c); })();\r\n\/\/ ]]><\/script><noscript>Powered by Cincopa <a href='http:\/\/www.cincopa.com\/video-hosting'>Video Hosting<\/a> for Business solution.<span>Service Day 2016<\/span><span>Sophomore Vivian Nguyen concentrates on sewing a bag for The Little Red Shoes Program as part of this year\u2019s sole on-campus service-learning activity.

David Starr Jordan, a vocal eugenicist, or a person who\u00a0supports improving the genetic population of humans through inhumane methods, was also Stanford University\u2019s first president,\u00a0a peace activist and ichthyologist. While some may claim that changing the school\u2019s name promotes a more welcoming environment, the school board should not do so as this would not properly address contemporary racism. In addition, eugenics was considered acceptable in much of the 19th and 20th centuries despite being discredited today, and a name change would cause confusion among community members and waste District funds.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, a name change would not make the middle school\u00a0a more welcoming environment for students as it would not\u00a0properly address racism in our schools and in general. As the son of a Polish father and Mexican mother, I know my ancestors have faced racism and anti-religious sentiment firsthand. David Starr Jordan himself wrote that Poles were \"controlled by\u00a0...\u00a0animal instincts\" and Mexicans \"ignorant and \"superstitious.\"\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But although my ancestors and ethnic groups have been victimized in the past, even through ethnic cleansing and other means, I do not believe changing Jordan's\u00a0name is the proper way to address contemporary racism. Altering Jordan\u2019s name would not have made any difference in my three-year experience as a Jordan student, nor did\u00a0it make me feel marginalized or persecuted in any way.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_118411\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"392\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMAG0421.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-118411\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMAG0421.jpg\" alt=\"IMAG0421\" width=\"392\" height=\"294\" \/><\/a> Jordan Middle School, pictured above, would most likely undergo campus changes such as new paint and a new logo if the name is changed. Photo by Sherwin Amsbaugh.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the district\u00a0wishes to address modern racism, it\u00a0should not focus on Jordan Middle School\u2019s name, but rather acknowledge social injustice and discrimination in America in social studies classes or through cultural clubs. After all, Jordan's views of eugenics have been mostly discredited and bear little significance in the modern\u00a0world. Changing the school\u2019s name would not address injustice; it would simply put a bandage on a deep cut.\u00a0The change\u00a0will not suddenly transform the district into an open-minded community. Teachers and staff should encourage cultural clubs to provide an in-depth look into social justice rather than bring attention to a name that many are unaware about if they wish to make schools more welcoming.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One may say that the district can both change the name and acknowledge social injustice in schools. While this is true,\u00a0there are other and more effective ways to make students feel welcome rather than\u00a0changing Jordan's name. Administration can use funds that may otherwise go to repainting the school to crack down on bullying and fund cultural programs, both of which are more likely to successfully promote tolerance and unity.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is terrible that David Starr Jordan fostered racist ideologies, he should not just be recognized as a eugenicist when he also promoted pacifism and contributed to the field of science. America\u2019s fourth president, Thomas Jefferson, is revered as a hero despite owning over 600 slaves. Similarly, Jordan should not be edited out of our history due to some of\u00a0his views which while inhumane, were standard in the late 19th century. It must be noted that at its peak, eugenics was supported by W.E.B Dubois, Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, all of whom are considered heroes in today's society. This does not mean that Jordan should be excused for his views, as they promoted racism in the 20th century. Rather,\u00a0we should look at his views in context and acknowledge that what is considered racist today was seen as standard 80\u00a0years ago.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to American historian and biographer Garland E. Allen, David Starr Jordan\u2019s views were considered common in his time.\r\n\r\n\u201cEugenics ... was a widespread and popular movement in the United States and Europe between 1910 and 1940,\u201d Garland wrote. \u201cEugenics gained much support from progressive reform thinkers, who sought to plan social development using expert knowledge in both the social and natural sciences.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changing a school\u2019s name because some find it offensive may also set a dangerous precedent. Basically every influential figure has been subject to some form of controversy, regardless of the nobility of their deeds. If we wished to avoid offending all Palo Altans, we would need to rename schools to streets, plants or locations.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A name change would foster additional consequences. Administration would most likely paint over all Jordan Middle School logos and alter all paperwork referring to the school as \u201cJordan,\u201d costing the district an unknown amount of money which could be better spent on new textbooks or educational facilities. The change could also cause confusion among citizens who are unaware of the name replacement.<\/span>\r\n\r\nDespite the name change's potential negative effects, some students continue to advocate for such a modification.\u00a0Social Justice Pathway\u00a0student and junior Layla Solatan says she\u00a0believes it would help create a more welcoming environment.\r\n\r\n\"Now that people have shown such passion for changing the name, to ignore their pleas would do harm to the image, values and environment of the district,\" Solatan said.\r\n\r\nHowever, a majority of students do not believe the name has a significant impact on them. The Voice visited random Paly English classrooms and posted a survey in the class Facebook groups to see how students felt about such a change. Of the 219 netted responses,\u00a0only 28.8 percent of students believe the current name creates an unhealthy environment for students, and 40.6\u00a0percent\u00a0support an actual name change. 68.5 percent of those who responded attended Jordan Middle School. These results demonstrate how, despite a\u00a0vehement\u00a0minority of students urging for a name change,\u00a0these students\u00a0do not represent their peers' views as a whole.\r\n\r\nSchool board member Melissa Baten Caswell says that while changing the name could set a positive example of upstanding,\u00a0it also could cause multiple community problems.\r\n\r\n\"There will be expenses involved with changing the name,\" Caswell said. \"Some members of the community are attached to the existing name.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the school board's advisory committee reaches a conclusion on the name's effects later this year, we should definitely listen and take into account their research and advice. However, at this point in time, a\u00a0Jordan name change is completely unnecessary. Further discussions about promoting tolerance in Palo Alto schools\u00a0are important and will help to create a healthier, more open-minded community\u2014but a Jordan name change is not the solution.","excerpt":"A Jordan Middle School name change is unnecessary due to potential costs and confusion as well as the fact that eugenics, while an atrocious practice, was universally accepted in the early 20th century.","date":"2016-03-24 21:09:40","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/unnamed.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["Alto","David","Eugenics","garland allen","jordan","middle","name","Palo","paly","racism","scandal","School","starr"]},{"id":117907,"title":"Paly and Gunn to face off at upcoming night rally","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/03\/23\/paly-and-gunn-to-face-off-at-upcoming-night-rally\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body and Gunn High School Student Executive Council are hosting an inter-school night rally at 7 p.m. tomorrow at the Gunn gym.\r\n\r\nASB and SEC created a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iA8JEM2QC-M&amp;feature=youtu.be\">promotional video<\/a> to advertise the rally for students, which will feature a relay race, a staff-student volleyball game and performances from both the Gunn and Paly dance and cheer teams.\r\n\r\nSenior Class President Eli Friedlander explained the relay\u00a0race in further detail.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_118386\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/FullSizeRender-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-118386\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/FullSizeRender-1.jpg\" alt=\"Juniors Kaitlyn Vi and Nora Danie stand in front of the promotional poster for the upcoming night rally.\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" \/><\/a> Juniors Kaitlyn Vi and Nora Danie stand before the promotional poster for the upcoming night rally.\u00a0Photo by Bianca Al-Shamari.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\"The first race will be a relay race between Paly upperclassmen versus Gunn upperclassmen,\" Friedlander said. \"Then Paly underclassmen versus Gunn underclassmen, finishing with a Paly and Gunn versus a combined staff volleyball game.\"\r\n\r\nFriedlander said that the rally will be a friendly competition between cross-town rivals.\r\n\r\n\"It should be a lot of fun-- a friendly competition with our cross town rivals and competition against the staff,\" Friedlander said. \"I'm hoping that Paly kids come out so we can prove exactly how loud we are.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Paly and Gunn cheer and dance teams will be having a joint performance, featured at the end of the volleyball game.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer and dance from both schools will be performing in a joint performance,\" senior Spirit Commissioner Reid Walters said. \"It'll be a special performance made just for the rally.\"\r\n\r\nGunn senior Human Relations Commissioner Misty Hong explains why Paly ASB and Gunn SEC collaborated on this event.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_118383\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"407\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_3953.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-118383\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_3953.jpg\" alt=\"T-Shirts will be sold on campus $10 for Short Sleeve and $15 for Baseball Sleeves.\" width=\"407\" height=\"305\" \/><\/a> T-Shirts will be sold on campus $10 for Short Sleeve and $15 for Baseball Sleeves.

Paly split its matches with Cupertino. Photo by Sam Lee.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School boys' tennis team split its two matches against Cupertino High School on Thursday\u00a0at Palo Alto High School.\r\n\r\nAccording to head coach Andy Harader, the team played two matches to make up for one that had been rained out earlier in the season. Instead of playing the two matches on separate days, both teams decided to play both matches on the same day in a compressed version.\r\n\r\n\u201cNormally, our league rules say you have to play two out of three sets,\u201d Harader said. \u201cBut because we were rained out and more rain is expected next week, we thought in order to expedite the matter we decided to try and fit them in one day. In order to do that, we played pro sets which allowed us to finish both matches in a day.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Harader, pro sets involve playing one set in which\u00a0the winner gets to eight games, instead of the traditional best out of three sets where the winner of each set is the first to six games.\r\n\r\nJunior Henry Badger said that despite the difficulty of playing the pro set style as opposed to the traditional three-set match, it was beneficial for the team's circumstances.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe pro set format is very tough, because unless you start off well, it is hard to win matches,\u201d Badger said. \u201cI prefer the best out of three set matches because it shows consistency and is better for the player mentally. However, I think the pro set format worked well in this circumstance.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the first match, the Vikings beat the Pioneers four matches to three. Despite senior Shiv Matta retiring due to fatigue, the Vikings were lifted by victories from senior Carl Goodfriend and junior Adrian Smith, among others.\r\n\r\nSmith was able to use his consistent groundstrokes to force his opponents into making unforced errors.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was able to stay consistent and keep my opponent on the run, which ended up being the deciding factor of the match,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMy opponent had trouble staying motivated when on the run so I decided to wait for him to miss instead of me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHarader also praised one of his team\u2019s double teams, made up of Badger and sophomore Hunter North, who were able to win both of their matches on the day. Badger attributed his success to his effective forehand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was able to win my match by staying consistent and managing to keep my serve in and effective,\u201d Badger said. \u201cI tried focusing on my forehand during the second match and tried to stay more consistent in that area.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings were unable to carry their momentum into the second match and ended up dropping it five matches to two.\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing a match that involved vomiting by multiple players due to fatigue and possible heat exhaustion, Harader believes that conditions played a role in the Vikings\u2019 loss.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, in both matches we had sickness,\u201d Harader said. \u201cThis is the first hot day and we played two matches in hot conditions. We probably need to condition more so that we are in better shape when we go into this kind of depth in a match situation.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter the loss, junior Jerry Hong said that the goal for the rest of the year is to make it to the postseason.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe're hoping that we can get the 50 percent win rate we need for us to qualify to CCS [Central Coast Section],\u201d Hong said. \u201cWe'll just need to keep working hard and playing our best.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' next match is against Monta Vista High School at 3:30 p.m. next Tuesday at Monta Vista High School.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' tennis team split its two matches against Cupertino High School on Thursday at Palo Alto High School.

Both teams were tied, 4-4, after the first quarter.\r\n\r\nAccording to head coach DJ Shelton, the team was able to pick up the pace after the first quarter.\r\n\r\n\"We came out really flat in the first quarter energy wise, missing ground balls,\" Shelton said. \"I think we got only open field ground ball, but then we answered in the last\u00a0three quarters\u00a0of the game.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings outscored the Wildcats 8-2 in the last three quarters.\r\n\r\nFreshman attacker Patrick McIntosh, who scored one goal and fed two assists, said the team felt compelled to take charge.\r\n\r\n\"We decided as a team we were done getting pushed around by the other team, and we wanted to come out and win this game,\" McIntosh said.\r\n\r\nMultiple players exhibited solid performances, including McIntosh, senior attacker Matthew Seligson\u00a0with three goals and five assists and junior midfielder Hayden Libbey with two goals, as well as others.\r\n\r\n\"[Senior] Charles Stephenson did really great on the faceoffs, [senior] Q Valenti was amazing between the pipes and our studs on the attack and midfield,\" Shelton said. \"Hayden played well; we had guys all over the field.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the win was a joint effort, according to Shelton.\r\n\r\n\"The game ball was a team win,\" Shelton said. \"It wasn't one player, and everyone had a part.\u00a0There wasn't one guy that just stepped out. It was a very well balanced game. For a coach, to have a team win is the best thing ever.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings worked on several aspects of their game and made amends to their tactics in preparation for the game after losing their last game to University High School, 12-10, according to Shelton.\r\n\r\n\"We just focused a lot on groundballs,\u00a0because that is kind of what lost us the game against University,\" Shelton said. \"We also need some personnel changes, we need to be a little more dynamic from the midfield, so we moved some of our better ball handlers up there and we just moved guys around to exploit matchups. We stopped being one dimensional and mixed things up to see what it would do for us, and it clearly worked.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Libbey, the win left a satisfactory taste for the team.\r\n\r\n\"It feels great to come back and win against the team we beat in the championship last season,\" Libbey said.\r\n\r\nShelton also expressed his enthusiasm on the win against the Wildcats.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing better than beating the team that you beat in the championship last year,\" Shelton said. \"We answered the challenge.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings play their next game against Sacred Heart Preparatory School (1-1) at 10 a.m. on Saturday at Sacred Heart.\r\n\r\nAccording to Libbey, the team is confident going into the matchup.\r\n\r\n\"We're playing SHP next game, so it's going to be a challenge, but we if we play our game and stick to our fundamentals, we are going to win,\" Libbey said. \"We lost to them in the preseason game, but we are better now than we were at that point of the season.\"\r\n\r\nShelton says if the team plays the way it did against the Wildcats, Paly has a good chance of beating Sacred Heart.\r\n\r\n\"We have Sacred Heart on Saturday morning, and we're really looking to doing what we did tonight,\" Shelton said. \"They are a similar team, athletic, fast, well coached. I don't think we need to change anything. If we stick to the game plan, we'll see where we can get the matchups.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' lacrosse team (5-2, 0-0) snatched a win against rival Los Gatos High School (1-3, 0-0) on Thursday at the Palo Alto High School field.

The girls' team won 10 out of 15 events and the boys' team took 13 out of 15.\r\n\r\n\"I think the team did wonderfully,\" freshman Henry Saul said. \"We had a band trip so we lost a lot of our varsity, but I think a lot of frosh-soph runners really picked it up.\"\r\n\r\nStandouts included junior Kent Slaney, who placed first in the 1600- and 3200-meter races while also competing in the 4x400-meter relay and sophomore Darby Felter who placed first in both the 110-meter hurdles and 300-meter hurdles.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Titi Bolarinwa, the weather and\u00a0the early lead over Homestead in addition to the absence of a significant portion of runners allowed the team to experiment with different events.\r\n\r\n\"It's really warm out so it's way different from last meet which was pouring rain,\" Bolarinwa said. \"It's a lot of firsts for a lot of people, because it's against Homestead so we could experiment a lot with this meet.\"\r\n\r\nThese conditions gave younger runners the opportunity to step up and prove themselves to the team, and allowed older runners to try out events they normally wouldn't run.\r\n\r\nThe teams' next meet is against Milpitas High School at 3:15 p.m. next Thursday at Milpitas High School.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_118194\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"748\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/I9P7145.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-118194\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/I9P7145.jpg\" alt=\"Senior Eli Givens bursts to the front during the 100-meters against Homestead at home on Thursday.
