We're training hard at practice and preparing as we countdown the days until this game. I'm very confident in our team that we have the better skill, stamina and mindset than Mountain View to win.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Viking captain Jacey Pederson has confidence in her team's chances and pushes her teammates to be better.\r\n\r\n\"We have a lot of strengths,\" Pederson said. \"Individually, we have some really good players, all who can do a lot so I think one thing we can work on is bringing that together.

Photo by Emma van der Veen.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nCaltrain, the commuter rail that runs from San Francisco to San Jose, is undertaking a project in collaboration with the City of Palo Alto to further restrict access to the train tracks by installing new fencing along both sides of the rail in Palo Alto.\r\n\r\nThe new fencing is a significant improvement from the previous protection from the rail, according to Palo Alto Unified School District Supt. Max McGee.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the fence] runs along the whole sides of the tracks,\u201d McGee said. \u201cSome of the fencing had been up before, and it was already secure, but they took out vegetation and this other fence that was frankly easy to climb.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to McGee, the improvement to fencing along the tracks is an effort to address the means by which multiple students have died by suicide in recent years. The fence should serve as a physical deterrent to gaining access to the tracks, but also as a symbol of the value that the community holds in its members lives, McGee said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a constant reminder of how important the city, the schools, the parents, the students consider each other's lives,\u201d McGee said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very positive reminder that you [the students] matter so deeply to us. If someone has this impulse to run onto the train tracks or to hop the fence, it will make it much more difficult. Sometimes, that little bit of delay is enough to make someone think \u2018Well, at least I'm going to call someone first.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly parent Lauren Barley was the first to thoroughly advocate for means restriction in Palo Alto, the limiting of access to the way by which the most well-known suicides have been committed in this community, following the first student suicide of the 2014-15 cluster of suicides within the Palo Alto community, according to McGee.\r\n\r\nBarley, who knows the family of the girl from Woodside that died by suicide in 2014, was moved by how the community came together in the wake of Byron's death, the Paly sophomore who committed suicide in March, 2015.\r\n\r\n\"I attended the two parent events that Paly held and was struck by how these deaths had such an extended and deep impact on administrators and students, even those who did not know Byron directly,\" Barley said.\r\n\r\nBarley researched \"means restriction,\" which, in the context of Palo Alto, specifically focused on railroad access. She presented her findings to Caltrain along with McGee and city officials.\r\n\r\n\"I was driven by the belief that reducing access to Caltrain in Palo Alto would reduce and prevent deaths by suicide,\" Barley said.\r\n\r\nAccording to McGee, the City of Palo Alto officials also assumed a great role in pursuing the effort to improve fencing and sensor technology along the Caltrain railroad by participating in meetings and advocating for the project.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [city officials] really took the lead in these meetings and persisted with Caltrain,\u201d McGee said. \u201cIt [the project] was funded by Caltrain and the city. They\u2019re also looking at putting in sensors to sense if someone does get over or around the fence at a crossing.\"\r\n\r\nRestricting the means by which someone may harm themselves serves as way to force them to slow down and does not allow them to act as impulsively as they might otherwise, according to McGee.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you have to climb, or get a ladder, or walk across one crossing or the other, that two to three minutes can make someone reconsider and think, \u2018What am I doing?\u2019\u201d McGee said.","excerpt":"Caltrain, the commuter rail that runs from San Francisco to San Jose, is undertaking a project in collaboration with the city of Palo Alto to further restrict access to the train tracks by installing new fencing along both sides of the rail in Palo Alto.","date":"2016-01-14 15:52:55","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/DSC_0010.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["caltrain","fence","McGee","means prevention","palo alto","palo alto high school","railroad","suicide","Suicide prevention","superintendent","tracks"]},{"id":114287,"title":"Celebration of Life for Kenyon Scott will be at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 23 on the Quad","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/14\/celebration-of-life-for-kenyon-scott-will-be-at-2-p-m-on-saturday-jan-23-on-the-quad\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-14 15:12:22","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":114259,"title":"Prom 2016 will be held at the Design Galleria in San Francisco","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/14\/prom-2016-will-be-held-at-the-design-galleria-in-san-francisco\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-14 11:02:43","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":114120,"title":"Girls&#8217; basketball dominates cross-town rival","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/12\/girls-basketball-dominates-cross-town-rival\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_114225\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_7851.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-114225\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_7851.jpg\" alt=\"Senior Coco Lovely sets up to shoot a free throw in the Friday game on Quad Night against cross-town rival Gunn High School.

A lot of that was being too nervous or us putting too much pressure on ourselves. We just have to relax.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe momentum shifted in the second quarter when junior forward Julie Chandler dished assists to sophomore forward Sophie Frick on backdoor cuts on two consecutive possessions. Frick\u2019s layups helped the Vikings take the lead, 22-19.\r\n\r\nSenior center Courtney Lovely was the leading scorer for the team with 13 points, though the Vikings struggled with shooting overall, according to senior guard Maddy Atwater.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe rush our shots sometimes and we don\u2019t need to,\u201d Atwater said. \u201cWe just have to relax and take our shots.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe amount of energy from the team, amplified by the crowd, helped Paly to come back from their first quarter performance, according to Peters.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey scored 19 points and we didn\u2019t get down,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIn the first quarter, we just kept at it with that same energy, and that paid off.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior guard Lauren Koyama also emphasized the significance of the team\u2019s energy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were very amped up,\u201d Koyama said. \u201cThe crowd brought energy that kind of made us overwhelmed, but we played well and we did what we wanted to do \u2026 we really got after it and we had a ton of energy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will face off against the Saratoga Falcons (10-4, 1-1) at 7 p.m. on Tuesday at Gunn, Paly\u2019s home gym for the season.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' basketball team (8-4, 1-1) routed cross-town rival Gunn High School (8-4, 0-2) with a 49-34 Quad Night win last Friday at Gunn.","date":"2016-01-12 22:29:32","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_7851.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap"],"tags":["ball is life","basketball","coco lovely","girls basketball","gunn","julie chandler","lauren koyama","maddy atwater","palo alto","palo alto high school","paly","Quad Night","scott peters","sophie frick","titans","vikings"]},{"id":114161,"title":"Football head coach resigns","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/12\/football-head-coach-resigns\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School football team is preparing to adapt to a new coaching situation, as its head coach's resignation from his position was confirmed on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nHead coach Jake Halas confirmed his resignation after two years in that position after taking over for long-time head coach Earl Hansen, largely because he wants to spend more time with his family.\r\n\r\n\u201cI did step down,\u201d Halas said. \u201cA variety of factors contributed to this, but the overriding factor was basically family.

Stoksik accredited much of the team\u2019s success to its defensive play.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoach told us to pick it up at halftime, and we did that,\u201d Stoksik said. \u201cI thought that we were really solid defensively and kept it tight.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly was able to secure the win through the effort of all of its players and their ability to work together, according to senior goalkeeper Eli Friedlander.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe stayed organized in the back, and they didn\u2019t get any clear cut chances,\u201d Friedlander said. \u201cEveryone came out here and played really hard. When we play as hard as we did today, we\u2019re going to win a lot of the 50-50 balls and that\u2019s going to put us in a good position to win a game.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to senior center defender Reuben Kramer, the Vikings struggled with staying focused and composed, as play was fast-paced throughout the match.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe struggled the most in keeping our composure,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThere were a couple of moments when we got excited when they had the ball and we started not thinking rationally. It was just us getting outside of our heads.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Mustangs were the biggest defensive challenge for Paly so far this season, according to Briggs.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were pushing us,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest that our defense has been pushed this year.\u201d\r\n\r\nBriggs intends to address the team\u2019s issue of staying in position and adjusting appropriately.\r\n\r\n\u201cRight now, we need to work on keeping our shape,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cWe have guys flying out to try to defend or get a ball and they leave a hole behind them and then they [other team] start play-making us.\u201d\r\n\r\nHomestead head coach Luis Comesana recognized his own team\u2019s struggle to possess and stay composed under high pressure.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe needed to possess the ball a little bit more,\u201d Comesana said. \u201cWe were rushed. We were put under pressure. I think that today, the better team won.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the score, Comesana remained proud of his players' resilience.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe fought back,\u201d Comesana said. \u201cAs a coach, you always want your players to give their best all the way to the end, no matter what the score is.\u201d\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, the Vikings hope to live up to <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/01\/22\/liveblog-boys-soccer-fights-for-first-in-league-against-homestead\/\">last year\u2019s record<\/a> with a De Anza League title, according to Stoksik.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we continue in this form, I think we definitely have a shot at winning league,\u201d Stoksik said.\r\n\r\nPaly will play its cross-town rivals, the Gunn Titans, at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday at Gunn High School.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 soccer team (2-0, 6-1) shut out the Homestead Mustangs (1-1, 7-2-2) 2-0 on Friday in its second De Anza League game of the season.\r\n","date":"2016-01-11 11:16:25","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_78001.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["boys soccer","briggs","comesana","de anza","friedlander","homestead","kramer","mustangs","palo alto high school","paly","Soccer","sports","stoksik","vikings"]},{"id":113812,"title":"Recap: Girls&#8217; soccer dominates Los Gatos","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/09\/recap-girls-soccer-dominates-los-gatos\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_114024\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"499\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-09-at-8.58.40-PM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-114024\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-09-at-8.58.40-PM.png\" alt=\"Sophomore Emily Tomz dribbles towards a Los Gatos defender as Paly takes an early 1-0 lead.
