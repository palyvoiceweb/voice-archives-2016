The freshman theme is \"Eye of the Tiger,\" \u00a0the sophomores, \"Firefighters,\" and the juniors, \"Boxing.\" \u00a0As per tradition, the senior class dressed up in 90\u2019s attire instead of its theme, \u201cGame Over.\u201d\r\n\r\nClear skies and temperate weather enabled a large student turnout to watch the lunchtime activities.\r\n\r\nThe sophomores managed to take first place in \u201cKnee Trembler\u201d after barely edging out the seniors, while the junior class won \u201cPass the Water.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite losing both of the new events, the senior class was able to get a win in the \u201cBanana Bump\u201d activity.\r\n\r\nAccording to senior Jackson Dahl, who won the event, the trick was to get some momentum going.\r\n\r\nDahl came from behind to get the win for the senior class.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I was practicing last night and I knew that it was hard to get started,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cBut once I got going, I knew I was unstoppable.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite not winning an event, members of the freshman class still had a good time.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe weren't exactly experienced, but it was fun nevertheless and I like dressing up,\u201d freshman Lanie Germain said. \u201cThe seniors helped us out a bit.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a minor disruption during a break between activities when several junior boys ran out onto the field holding a sign containing profanity targeted at the senior class.

Each theme corresponds with each class\u2019 color: orange for freshmen, red for sophomores, yellow for juniors and green for seniors.\r\n\r\nThis year, the freshman theme is \u201cEye of the Tiger,\u201d the sophomore theme is \u201cFirefighters,\u201d the junior theme is \u201cBoxing\u201d and the senior theme is \u201cGame Over.\u201d Rather than wearing clothes that correspond to their theme, due to Paly tradition, seniors instead wear 90s apparel on Monday.\r\n\r\nThis year, Spirit Week festivities open at lunch on the football field with the lunchtime rally, which will feature three main events: Knee Trembler, Banana Bump and Pass the Water.\r\n\r\nKnee Trembler, a new event to Paly Spirit Week, is a mini relay race consisting of three students from each grade. Using only their knees, students must pick up an orange and hop over to a hula hoop placed on the ground. Whoever has placed the most oranges in the hoop at the end of a minute will win.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Knee Trembler game, the Banana Bump event will take place. This time, only one student from each grade will participate. The student will have a banana tied around his or her waist and must bump an orange, using the banana, past the finish line.\r\n\r\n\"The other new game is Pass the Water,\" ASB Spirit Commissioner Michaela Fogarty said. \"Participants line up and transfer water from one bucket to another by passing it to each other over their heads with cups. The grade with the most water in the final bucket wins.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Fogarty, the results of the events are unpredictable.\r\n\r\n\"None of the grades are projected to win any of the games,\" Fogarty said. \"It should be very competitive and exciting to watch.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the points awarded for the events, class cheers and scores for best dressed will award each grade with extra points. Cheers at each rally can earn up to 800 points for first place and up to 500 points for the best dressed contest.\r\n\r\nUp to 150 points of deductions are possible for sportsmanship and cleanliness.\r\n\r\nFor more information on lunchtime rallies and the Spirit Week scoring system, refer to the <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/pahsasb\/sw2016\" target=\"_blank\">ASB master schedule<\/a>.

The full discussion agenda can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boarddocs.com\/ca\/pausd\/Board.nsf\/goto?open=&amp;id=AEETTD772CFC\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\nA number of Palo Alto parents and students\u00a0are pushing for the option of reporting weighted GPAs, and have sent numerous messages to Paly administration and the school board, according to Principal Kim Diorio.\r\n\r\nPTSA President Katie Shade sent an e-mail to Paly parents on Wednesday to inform them of Paly's\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1dgRurvVuzDXtwWqByW2LQgKYiFhHWuQ84r_lCxhSteY\/edit\">position statement<\/a>\u00a0in response to the message.\r\n\r\nPaly's position paper states that the administration and faculty \"feel strongly that when schools use weighted grades, a culture of competition and stress develops\" and stand against submitting weighted GPAs. Stating there should be no submitting of weighted GPAs for this years' graduating class, which has caused uproar from some parents and students\r\n\r\nIn a meeting with the Paly Associated Student Body, Diorio outlined her concerns with submitting weighted GPAs.\r\n\r\n\"By having an unweighted transcript, it draws focus away from student competition and will help reduce stress,\" Diorio said. \"[Gunn Principal] Dr. [Denise] Herrmann and I\u00a0have\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">big goals in redefining success and strengthening Gunn and Paly culture. We want to have a<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lternate pathways to success, where students are more than their GPA.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, for the past 35 years Paly has been exclusively reporting unweighted grades. Neither Gunn nor Paly report weighted grades on transcripts, and Gunn reports weighted grades within applications.\r\n\r\nGunn School Board Representative senior Ankit Ranjan says this difference between the schools' reporting methods has pushed students from both PAUSD high schools to voice their opinions on the matter at the upcoming board meeting.\r\n\r\n\"Gunn students can ask to have either their weighted or unweighted GPA reported [to colleges],\" Ranjan said. \"We're currently working with members of the Paly community with [Paly senior] Maya Katz in getting more students involved at Tuesday's\u00a0board meeting.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boarddocs.com\/ca\/pausd\/Board.nsf\/goto?open&amp;id=AEPV5U7F1FB4\">School Board agenda<\/a>, the primary argument in support of weighted grades to this point has revolved around scholarships for out of state public schools, particularly University of Oregon. Scholarship money is important, and according to counselors, is increasingly\u00a0more of a factor for students making decisions as to what institutions they will apply\u00a0to and\u00a0attend.\u00a0 The discussion around weighted grading arose from a conversation several months ago regarding the University of Oregon\u2019s practices for awarding merit scholarships.\u00a0 The University awards an automatic $36,000 Summit Scholarship for out of state students with a GPA of 3.8 or higher, and an automatic $16,000 Apex Scholarship for a GPA of 3.6 or higher.\u00a0 They do not recalculate GPAs and only use what is on the transcript.\r\n\r\nConcerns\u00a0raised by parent and students of the Paly community are primarily represented by Katz and her family. Katz has recently reached out to Paly and Gunn Student Executive Council (SEC) in bringing more student voice into the issue.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent meeting with Paly ASB, Katz articulated her position on the issue, stating the need for the submission of weighted GPAs for students seeking scholarships.\r\n\r\n\"I've come to ASB to get more students informed on the issue, and to make sure students are able to understand what is at stake,\" Katz said. \"By releasing only unweighted GPAs we become ineligible for merit-based scholarships for universities. Students with an unweighted GPA of 3.75, for example, and a weighted GPA of 4.0 will not be eligible for scholarships that require a 3.8. That's $36,000 or more just because of the report. I've spoken to the admissions staff for universities like University of Oregon and they blatantly said they would not accept this GPA for a\u00a0scholarship. If a weighted GPA were submitted, this wouldn't be the case.\"\r\n\r\nKatz says she wants\u00a0all students to have a say regardless of if they agree or disagree with her opinion, and is currently working with her family and a community of parents in doing research to better inform members of the Paly community\u00a0of the issue.\r\n\r\n\"There are a lot of parents involved in this, and it's important to be getting more students involved,\" Katz said.\u00a0\"It will affect them directly.\"\r\n\r\nKatz will be speaking at\u00a0the upcoming board meeting this Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMcGee recommends that the board not make any change for this years' graduating seniors (class of 2017), and then make a decision after community involvement. He has mentioned that he is predisposed to not offering a weighted grade option in order to limit our emphasis on honors and AP classes, but doesn't want to make a decision without consulting students, according to statements made by Ranjan, Diorio and Paly School Board Representative David Tayeri.\r\n\r\nAccording to McGee, the board meeting will not feature a vote on the issue that day, but will instead be a chance for an open discussion that could lead to a vote in the future.\r\n\r\n\"Please let everyone know that there is no action item\u00a0on the agenda for the 18th,\" McGee stated according to the email from Shade. \"[The meeting] is an information[al] discussion item that may or may not lead to action at a future date.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcGee is interested in receiving comprehensive student input, according to Tayeri. McGee has contacted Tayeri in providing an outlet for students to voice their concerns.\r\n\r\n\"Until a couple years ago, board members would buy pizza and invite students to discuss their views on issues,\" Tayeri said. \"They'd have time to talk to board members one-on-one. They haven't done this in a few years, but I think it would be a good idea to bring that back. There is enough student engagement that we would have a good turnout.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education will be discussing whether PAUSD High Schools' will be submitting weighted or unweighted grade point averages (GPAs) to colleges at 6:30 Tuesday Oct. 18. at the district office.","date":"2016-10-16 15:52:33","author":"Bianca Al-Shamari","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMG_0070.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["ASB","board meeting","college","diorio","gpa","grades","gunn","herrmann","high school","McGee","paly","sec","tayeri","transcipts","unweighted","weighted"]},{"id":124267,"title":"Vikings defeat Gunn to redeem themselves","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/16\/vikings-defeat-gunn-to-redeem-themselves\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_124368\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"602\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Celebration1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-124368\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Celebration1.jpg\" alt=\"The Vikings celebrate last night in the Gunn High School gym.
