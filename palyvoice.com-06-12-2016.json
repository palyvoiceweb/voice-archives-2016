According to junior outside hitter Denise\u00a0Ringwalt, the team had a great season, and improved much more over the span of the season than they had in the recent past. \"Last year everyone got along but we didn't improve as much together as we did this year,\" Ringwalt said. \u00a0Photo: William Sallomi.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School volleyball team is celebrating \u00a0an impressive overall record of 23-11 and a successful season, which ended after\u00a0a loss to the Turlock High School Bull Dogs (28-12, 10-2) the night of\u00a0Nov. 16 at the Turlock gym in the first\u00a0round of the Northern California playoffs.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings had a tough preseason, facing\u00a0off against top level competition like the St. Ignatius College Prepatory Wildcats (32-9, 4-1)\u00a0and the Valley Christian High School Warriors (28-12, 1-4). These rigorous matches served as solid preparation for the season ahead and were ultimately crucial in helping the girls acclimate to the new roster.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior outside hitter Denise\u00a0Ringwalt, once the season officially began, the girls began to better combine their talents and work together.\r\n\r\n\"I think the team this year was filled with extremely talented girls that worked together better and better as the season went on,\" Ringwalt said.\r\n\r\nOnly the Los Altos High School Eagles (22-15, 7-5), out of all of the teams in the De Anza League, were able to defeat\u00a0the Vikings, who finished the league with a remarkable\u00a0record of 11-1.\r\n\r\nThe season had several high points, including a nail-biting match against the Eagles in which the Vikings won each set 25-22, and shattered a three-year losing streak to the Eagles.\r\n\r\nDespite having an excellent season, Los Gatos High School Wildcats (20-16, 7-5)\u00a0overpowered the Vikings in the Central Coast Section\u00a0championship match.\u00a0According to Ringwalt, the loss was unexpected and unfortunate for the hard working Vikings, and the injury of junior outside hitter Chelsea Fan was a key factor in the\u00a0defeat.\r\n\r\n\"The CCS championships was a really difficult loss,\" Ringwalt said.\u00a0\"The team worked really hard, but when Chelsea got hurt, everyone kinda fell apart.\"\r\n\r\nFan said despite not making it as far as she had hoped, she is proud of the team and what it accomplished this season.\r\n\r\n\"A couple injuries toward the end made it [the season] end a little sooner than it truly should have, but overall I'm happy with how far we went this year compared to previous seasons,\" Fan said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings must say goodbye to many talented seniors, including\u00a0setters\u00a0Cassie Fong and Jessica Lee, and outside hitters Fiona Green and Katie Passarello. Fan said the seniors performed well throughout the year and will be tough to replace.\r\n\r\n\"The seniors were a huge part of our team this year and they contributed a lot on the court,\" Fan said. \"Next year we'll definitely have trouble filling their spots.\"\r\n\r\nThe team as a whole\u00a0displayed excellent chemistry on and off the court, which was a significant strength and advantage.\u00a0According to Fan, returning Paly players built upon chemistry that they formed during the previous year.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of girls who started this year played together last season so our on-court team chemistry was great,\" Fan said.\r\n\r\nThis chemistry will play a role in the strength of the Vikings next season, who will take their experience this year and continue to\u00a0work to create another high-level team.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School volleyball team is celebrating  an impressive overall record of 23-11 and a successful season, which ended after a loss to the Turlock High School Bull Dogs (28-12, 10-2) in the first round of the States competition.","date":"2016-12-04 20:56:31","author":"William Sallomi","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/VB-VS-Gunn.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["CCS","Chelsea Fan","deedee ringwalt","season recap","sports","volleyball"]},{"id":126695,"title":"Verbatim: What&#8217;d you do over the Thanksgiving break?","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/04\/verbatim-whatd-you-do-over-the-thanksgiving-break\/","content":"Last week, Palo Alto High School students and faculty enjoyed a break from school for the Thanksgiving holiday.

We are definitely looking to win [CCS] this year.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to senior defender Lauola Amanoni, the loss of last year\u2019s seniors Jacey Pederson, Heidi Moeser and Allison Lu will greatly affect the leadership of the team, but this year\u2019s returning upperclassmen are prepared to fill those roles.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [Pederson, Moeser, and Lu] were a huge part of our success last year and we\u2019ll definitely miss them but we have many players such as Tess [Preising], Talia [Malchin], and Emily [Tomz] who are ready to take over with leadership,\u201dAmanoni said.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the team will be just as competitive as last season due to the addition of talented underclassmen, according to Preising.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe lost some good talent but we have many new players that can fill their spots,\u201d Preising said. \u201c[freshman forward] Chloe Japi\u0107 is someone to definitely watch for.\u201d\r\n\r\nPreising said the team's biggest weakness is its lack of chemistry due to new players.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the weakness right now is that we are all not very comfortable with each other on the field and don\u2019t know each other's strengths or weaknesses yet,\u201d Preising said. \u201cHopefully through more practice, we will get better and more cohesive in our play.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will take on rivals, Menlo-Atherton High School, at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday at Paly.","excerpt":"After a riveting, 3-2, loss to Mountain View High School in the Central Coast Section championship match last season, the Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 soccer team hopes to make another playoff run despite the loss of key seniors.","date":"2016-12-02 09:42:54","author":"Ethan Kao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/GIRLS-SOCCER-Season-recap.png","categories":["Sports","Spotlight","Uncategorized"],"tags":["almost","amazing","but","cccs","CCS","finals","football","girls","great","jacey pederson","mountain view","no","Soccer","tess","won"]},{"id":126517,"title":"&#8216;Loving&#8217;: What&#8217;s not to love?","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/01\/loving-whats-not-to-love\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_126666\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"430\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/1475626768_focusfeatures_loving_jeffnichols_joeledgerton_ruthnegga_voteloving_instagram1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-126666\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/1475626768_focusfeatures_loving_jeffnichols_joeledgerton_ruthnegga_voteloving_instagram1.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton star in the latest historical film 'Loving'. Photo: Focus Features\" width=\"430\" height=\"430\" \/><\/a> Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton star in the latest historical film 'Loving'. Photo: Focus Features[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDid you know that interracial marriage wasn\u2019t always legal in the United States? In the non-fiction, historical-drama film , 'Loving,' directed by Jeff Nichols, the audience follows two main characters \u2014 a black woman, Mildred, and a white man, Richard \u2014 who fall in love and want to get married despite obstacles; however, it\u2019s not that simple.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both lived most of their lives in the small town of Central Point, Virginia, which takes place in the late 1960's, where interracial marriage was illegal at the time, and one was only allowed to marry someone of his or her own race. The movie is told through Mildred and Richard\u2019s eyes. While they are living in Virginia, police arrest them in their own home, in the middle of the night, for breaking the anti-miscegenation laws of their state. They move to the nation\u2019s capital, Washington, D.C., to get married and to raise their three children. Little did they know that during this time, with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, their experience with the law would be a gateway to make a change for equality.<\/span>\r\n\r\nBoth Joel Edgarton and Ruth Negga do a satisfying job in their roles as Richard and Mildred. They have good chemistry on emotional scenes, such as, powerful expressions on their faces so the audience would figure out what they were feeling, some could see them working together in the future. Bernie Cohen, played by Nick Kroll, is the lawer who picks up this case. This character plays as comic relief because he is an ackward person as a result of the words he uses and his posture on scene, which is what Nichols is going for. His partner Phill Bass, played by Jon Bass, is the more serious lawer that keeps him in check. Both of these characters do a good job of creating suspense in the film.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the story unfolds, the audience can't help but side with and cheer on the couple because of the connection they have and everything they have been through. Some people at the time got harassed for being in a multi-racial relationship; they were judged by peers and loved ones. The love that Mildred and Richard share for each other and the conflicted emotions that others have toward them make it clear that this story is going to pull at some heartstrings.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Movie's cinematographer Adam Stone, portrays police in the movie as villains who will do anything to get the protagonists in jail. Stone uses dark lighting and body language well with these characters, highlighting the use of their aggressive nature and atmosphere that is apparent. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, throughout the movie it was hard to understand the dialogue between characters because of their accents and soft voices, which some could argue made the movie more realistic, but at times made the conversations harder to understand.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the movie continues, you feel the injustice of these laws. The government is dictating who people are allowed to love and marry. Mildred and Richard are everyday people who weren\u2019t looking for fame or publicity but rather just wanted what most of us desire, a person to love and be with forever and a chance at happiness. This movie is a must see for those looking for good character development, an authentic snapshot of that time and an emotionally uplifting story that will put you in the shoes of the people who fought against the law.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Loving<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rating: PG-13<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Run time: 123 minutes <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Director: Jeff Nichols<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<b>Actors\/Actresses: Joel Edgerton as Richard, Ruth Negga as Mildred, \u00a0Michael Shannon as Grey Villet, Nick Kroll as Bernie Cohen, Marton Csokas as Sheriff Brooks, Alano Miller as Raymond Green, and Jon Bass as Phil Bass<\/b>","excerpt":"Did you know that interracial marriage wasn\u2019t always legal in the United States?

The first half ended with a score of 2-1.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAt the beginning, we were moving the ball around really well and using the field,\u201d head coach Don Briggs said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half was much less eventful, with no goals scored. Although both teams had chances on goal, neither were able to put the ball in the net. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe definitely had a better first half,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cWe had a lot of opportunities [in the second half], we just didn\u2019t quite put it [the ball] away. We had chances in the second half where, if we put it away, the game would\u2019ve been over.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vikings had matches\u00a0on both Tuesday and Wednesday, which Briggs suspects caused the team to fatigue later on in the game.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYesterday\u2019s game took a little bit of a toll on us,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cWe seemed a little tired and weren\u2019t moving quite as well. We had guys cramping up, which usually means more conditioning [is needed]. That made the second half tougher.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Morabia, Paly\u2019s effort showed through its consistent contact throughout the match.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe had a lot of passion and determination toward the end of the game,\u201d Morabia said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what won us the game.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior center defender and captain Neil Verwillow says that the lack of attack in the second half was executed in an effort to preserve Paly\u2019s lead.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe didn\u2019t have much offensive thrust in the second half,\u201d Verwillow said. \u201cAfter half time, we wanted to preserve the lead rather than extending it.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up, the Vikings will face Lincoln High School at 11 a.m. on Saturday at Homestead High School Stadium.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 soccer team (2-0-0, 0-0-0) triumphed over the Carlmont High School Scots (1-0-1, 0-0-0) 2-1 yesterday at Paly in a preseason match.","date":"2016-12-01 17:55:45","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/DSC_0060.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["atheltics","boys soccer","briggs","carlmont","carlmont high school","jack stoksik","jason shorin","kenzo morabia","kiran misner","marco tan","misner","morabia","neil verwillow","palo alto high school","paly athletics","preseason","shorin","Soccer","sports","stoksik","tan","verwillow","vikings"]},{"id":126331,"title":"Season Preview: Wrestling team hopes to thrive in lower division","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/01\/season-preview-wrestling-team-hopes-to-thrive-in-lower-division\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_116559\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"617\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screenshot-2016-02-18-at-8.50.58-AM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-116559\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screenshot-2016-02-18-at-8.50.58-AM.png\" alt=\"Members of the Palo Alto wrestling team pose for a picture after competing at the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League Championships last weekend. \" width=\"617\" height=\"422\" \/><\/a> Members of the Palo Alto wrestling team pose for a picture after competing at the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League Championships last season.

I would have to say that the highlight of the season was beating Menlo-Atherton at the beginning of the CCS tournament because it was a super close game, and we lost to them at the beginning of our season.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior goalkeeper Joanna Falla was in accordance with Chalmers\u2019 thoughts.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was definitely a growing year for the team and I'm incredibly excited to see how the team does next year,\u201d Falla said. \u201cThis season has been an incredible experience, and it was amazing to see the team chemistry build throughout the games and practices.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior field player Talia Stanley also voiced\u00a0her gratitude for the seniors on the team.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAlthough we had some losses here and there, the season was incredibly fun and I took it as an opportunity to learn and develop my game,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cThe seniors on the team are great because they were vocal in telling us what to do or to not do, and because of that, the team communication really improved.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Falla said she is bittersweet about leaving the team next year and she gave her departing thoughts on the team.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI'm pretty sentimental about leaving the team,\u201d Falla said. \u201cI had never played water polo before high school, so leaving definitely is hard. The team is full of amazing, hilarious girls, and that's probably what I'll miss most. I have complete faith that the team will do just as well, if not better, next season. Next season, I'm expecting [junior field player] Sabrina Hall, [freshman field player] Chesnie Cheung and Talia Stanley to make some great plays; but I truly think that everyone will be integral to the team.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalmers expressed similar sentiments as Falla, and praised newcomer freshman Chesnie Cheung.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI am pretty sad about leaving this team \u2013 we really grew this season and I know they are going to do really well next year,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cI think that the juniors will be great leaders next year, and we have a pretty young team so there's a lot of potential there. I think one of our younger players, Cheung, really stood out this year. It was her first year ever playing water polo, and ended up being one of the starters and our strongest players.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The girls\u2019 water polo team hopes to return with a vengeance next autumn, according to Stanley.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe will continue to practice and improve, and next year, we hope to make it farther in the postseason to win the CCS championship,\u201d Stanley said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 water polo team (14-16, 4-8) concluded its season with a loss to Leland High School in the second round of the Central Coast Section (CCS) playoffs on Nov. 5 at a neutral location.","date":"2016-11-29 09:05:05","author":"Sam Lee","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/IMG_4533.jpg","categories":["Sports","water polo"],"tags":["CCS","haley chalmers","joanna falla","leland high school","paly","season recap","talia stanley","tournament","vikings","water polo"]}]
