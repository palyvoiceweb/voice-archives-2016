Stay tuned on major networks to see the final election results. Check out the in-depth state election results <a href=\"http:\/\/apps.mercurynews.com\/election-results-2016\/#santaclaracounty\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>9:33 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNevada, with six electoral votes, goes to Clinton. Clinton has 215 votes to Trump's 244.\r\n\r\n<strong>9:25 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Dow Jones has dropped more than 800 points, and the NASDAQ is stumbling, according to NBC.\r\n\r\n<strong>9:21 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton leads in Nevada, though it is too close to project a winner.\r\n\r\n<strong>9:13 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump is only 26 electoral votes from becoming the next president of the United States.\r\n\r\n<strong>9:10 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn comparison to 2012, fewer people voted for third party candidates than in this year's election.\r\n\r\n<strong>9:09 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"He [Trump] won this by trashing the press. He won this by saying things we thought you couldn't say,\" says an NBC reporter.\r\n\r\n<b>9:07 p.m.<\/b>\r\n\r\nFun Fact #9: It is important to note that the electoral college can vote for whomever they want, even if the voters in their state choose otherwise. Throughout American history, although there have been instances where electoral members have voted for someone other than who the public voted for, it has never changed the outcome of the election.\r\n\r\n<strong>9:02 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton's popular vote is at 47% to Trump's 48%.\r\n\r\nAs of now, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania are too close to call. However, Trump is still projected to win.\r\n\r\n<strong>8:47 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nProposition 53, which requires statewide voter approval for bonds over 2 billion dollars, is split by 50%.\r\n\r\n<b>8:44 p.m.<\/b>\r\n\r\nJohnson and Stein take up a total of 2.7% of popular votes. Could this have swayed the election results?\r\n\r\n<strong>8:37 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCrowds of Trump supporters can be seen jumping and cheering, while Clinton supporters seem to be quiet.\r\n\r\n<b>8:35 p.m.<\/b>\r\n\r\nDemocrats lag in the presidential, Senate, and House of Representatives races.\r\n\r\n<strong>8:33 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFun Fact #8: Kamala Harris is the second African-American woman to be elected to the US Senate.\r\n\r\n<strong>8:31 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump just won Utah, NBC says. He leads with 228 electoral votes over Clinton's 209.\r\n\r\n<strong>8:27 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf Trump takes Michigan and Arizona, ABC predicts Trump will win the presidency.\r\n\r\n<strong>8:26 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Dow Jones is down around 700 points, which is the largest dip since the Great Recession.\r\n\r\n<b>8:25 p.m.<\/b>\r\n\r\nProposition 64 in California is projected to pass, which may legalize\u00a0the use of recreational marijuana. Kamala Harris has just been elected to the US Senate.\r\n\r\n<strong>8:19 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump leads in Utah, Montana, and Iowa.\r\n\r\n<b>8:17 p.m.<\/b>\r\n\r\nFun Fact #7: Clinton was a part of Wellesley Young Republicans Club, and grew up in a conservative Illinois household.\r\n\r\n<strong>8:12 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump takes North Carolina.\r\n\r\n<strong>8:11 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFun Fact #6: If Clinton wins the presidency, daughter Chelsea Clinton will be the first person to have both parents in the White House.\r\n\r\n<strong>8:01 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCalifornia, Oregon and Washington voted for Clinton; Idaho voted for Trump.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:57 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nElection website 270 to Win appears to have crashed.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:54 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump has won Florida. This makes Clinton's path to victory much more difficult.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:47 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn order for Clinton to win, she must win Wisconsin AND Michigan, along with either New Hampshire or Nevada.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:42 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn Michigan, Trump has 49 percent to Clinton's 46 percent. Trump's lead has shrank by a little bit, but is it enough?\r\n\r\n<strong>7:37 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAP hasn't updated the results in a long time. It looks like Trump has the edge.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:28 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNBC reports that Virginia has gone for Clinton. This was a state she needed to win.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:24 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOhio has gone for Trump. Polls in California close in about half an hour.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:18 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThere are many states too close to call. \u00a0Wisconsin is slowing inching towards Clinton. New Hampshire remains red.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:08 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAt this point, it looks like it will be very difficult for Democrats to capture the Senate. Republicans have 44 seats; Democrats 42.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:06 p.m.\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNBC calls New Mexico for Clinton; Missouri for Trump.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:54 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNBC reporting that Clinton has taken the lead in Virginia. Minnesota also trending blue. Wisconsin and Michigan still trending red.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:48 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton is slowly gaining votes in Virginia. Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin are all trending red. I think we may be seeing the Brexit effect in the United States.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:43 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWith 90 percent voting in Virginia, Trump is ahead by 16,000 votes.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:41 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf Trump wins the election, I will be very disappointed in many the polls that showed Clinton ahead.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:38 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton can afford to lose North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire and Arizona if Clinton holds her other firewall states. Unfortunately for Clinton, Virginia currently leans red. So does Minnesota and Michigan.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:33 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIs anyone else really surprised by how close the\u00a0results are so far? I thought Clinton had it in the bag.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:28 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton still trails Trump, this time 97 to 129 electoral votes, according to AP.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:20 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"It's incredibly how tight all these races are,\" an NBC reporter says.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:13 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMichigan is extremely close, with Trump in the lead by a few hundred votes.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:05 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton now trails in the electoral college with 97 votes to Trump's 123, after Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Texas voted red while New York voted blue.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:00 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAccording to AP,\r\n\r\nClinton has won: DE, DC, MD, MA, NJ, RI, IL and VT (68 electoral votes)\r\n\r\nTrump has won: AL, IN, KY, MS, OK, SC, TN and WV (66 electoral votes)\r\n\r\nOther news organizations are reporting different demographics.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:56 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAccording to ABC News, Republicans will retain control of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:52 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton has lead in Virginia all night. This will concern her supporters, as the state was considered by many pundits to be a safe state for her.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:44 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFun Fact #5:\u00a0Hillary was part of the presidential impeachment inquiry of President Richard Nixon.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:42 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton leads in Michigan and Pennsylvania, both of which are too early to call. Trump and Clinton are both beginning to solidify leads in a\u00a0plethora of other states.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:35 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"We are feeling really good ... It's\u00a0still early, but we're\u00a0feeling really good about the ground we have\u00a0mustered,\" a Clinton spokeswoman says.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:32 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNBC reporters are highlighting the importance of Florida, where Trump currently has a slight edge. \"It becomes increasingly difficult for Trump to win without Florida.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>5:29 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump has won Tennessee and Alabama, securing 60 electoral votes to Clinton's 44.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:18 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAP shows that Trump now has a slight lead in the electoral college, with 51 votes to Clinton's 44.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:17 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn the Senate race, Democrats lead in New Hampshire, North Carolina and have won Connecticut and Maryland. Republicans have won Ohio, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Florida and are leading in Indiana, Alabama and Georgia.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:14 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNote: The Paly Voice will not be able to begin reporting on local polls until at least 8 p.m., as that is when polls here closed.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:09 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump is ahead in Texas, Tennessee and Alabama. Clinton wins Delaware. Clinton is ahead overall, 44 electoral votes to 31, according to Associated Press.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:07 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nElection Fun Fact #3: If elected, Trump would be the second\u00a0president to be divorced.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:02 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAssociated Press reports that Trump won Oklahoma; Clinton won Maryland, New Jersey &amp; Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:55 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"All eyes are on New York, where the polls are closing,\" an NBC reporter says.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:51 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNBC has called South Carolina for Trump.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:41 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton now leads in New Hampshire; Trump leads in Ohio.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:37 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump is leading in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia &amp; New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:34 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nElection Fun Fact #2:\u00a0A candidate has lost the election after winning the popular vote\u00a0four times. The last was Al Gore versus George W. Bush in 2000. The others are: Grover Cleveland in 1888;\u00a0Samuel Tilden in 1876; and Andrew Jackson in 1824.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:32 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump has won West Virginia (with five electoral votes). According to NBC, Trump supporters should be worried by Clinton's current lead in Florida.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:31 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPolls have closed in Ohio, North Carolina and West Virginia. South Carolina is leaning towards Trump.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:30 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFlorida is now leaning blue again. Is it just me, or does Florida always make elections 10 times more wild?\r\n\r\n<strong>4:28 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are in the Bay Area and still need to vote, polls will be open for 3.5 more hours.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:22 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAs the votes come in, many swing states are flipping back and forth in terms of who is in the lead. Trump takes the lead in Virginia and Georgia. Florida is extremely competitive; Trump is ahead by three percent.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:21 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAccording to NBC, the candidates are the least popular Presidential candidates in history.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:16 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nResults from Virginia are beginning to be revealed. Clinton leads, 50 percent to 45 percent, with about 7,000 votes counted.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:12 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump is leading Clinton, 57 percent to 28 percent, in Florida. However, Florida's major liberal cities have not tallied their votes yet.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:10 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSenator Marco Rubio (aka \"Little Marco\") is currently ahead in the Florida senate race.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:07 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTo pass the time, we will be peppering this liveblog with election fun facts!\r\n\r\nFun fact #1:\u00a0At 70, Donald Trump would be the oldest candidate to be elected as a first-term president. Ronald Reagan was 69 when he won his first term, and 73 when he won for the second time.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:03 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton has won Vermont; Trump wins Indiana. Trump leads with 19 electoral votes to Clinton's three.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:01 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump has officially won Kentucky (no surprise)!\r\n\r\n<strong>3:36 p.m.\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump's lead in Kentucky and Indiana is rapidly growing. In New Hampshire, only 57\u00a0votes have been counted.\r\n\r\n<strong>3:23 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump is now leading in Indiana\u2014Not a surprise, given that Trump's running mate Mike Pence is the governor of the state.\r\n\r\n<strong>3:14\u00a0p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPresidential results are slowing coming in in Kentucky and New Hampshire. Donald Trump is\u00a0leading in both, but few votes have been counted.\r\n\r\n<strong>3:09 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe very first results are coming through, but they don't relate to California. Republican Senate candidates Kelly Ayotte and Rand Paul lead in New Hampshire and Kentucky, respectively.\r\n\r\n<strong>3:05 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThank you for tuning into The Paly Voice's liveblog!

The Morning Conduct carried out a <a href=\"https:\/\/morningconsult.com\/trump-clinton-unpopular\/\">survey<\/a>\u00a0asking voters who disapproved of the two candidates about the reasons for their views. To nobody's surprise, Clinton haters called her a liar, and 56 percent of voters think Trump is a racist. So why should anyone look up to either of these two as our president?\r\n\r\nWell, the answer lies in our country's roots. America has always been\u00a0a nation driven by compromise: it is what allows us to function and thrive as a country. Our unique ability to work together despite sometimes having starkly differing\u00a0opinions is imperative for finding middle ground on important issues and ultimately solving them.\r\n\r\nGenerally we live in a country where there is a division of power amongst the two major political parties. It is rare for Democrats or Republicans\u00a0to hold the White House as well as a majority in both houses of Congress, meaning that most\u00a0of American history has been\u00a0comprised of inter-party collaboration.\r\n\r\nWhen we sacrifice our willingness to cooperate we give up our power to solve problems and continue to move forward as a nation.\u00a0Part of what makes our political system\u00a0so special is that we don't quit.\u00a0Every four years\u00a0roughly\u00a0half the population is disappointed by the outcome of the presidential election, and that's just the nature of the system. However upsetting the result may be to some people, we all continue to work together\u00a0in the meantime, and the losers simply try again in four years.\r\n\r\nThe worst decision Americans can truly make is to fail to honor the sacred electoral system that holds our great nation together. These next four years will\u00a0be one the most consequential periods of modern American history, and we cannot look at issues like the war on terror and restoring the American economy with minds turned away from the idea of collaboration.\r\n\r\nWe could all spend the next four years complaining about how this November forced us to choose between the lesser of two evils, but where would that get us? I implore you, in an election season overrun by paranoia and hate, to see our next president as the leader of our nation, not the face of the party you didn't vote for.","excerpt":"Regardless of whether you're \"with her\" or if you want to \"make America great again,\" it is our duty as citizens of the United States to support our president, even if we have to grin and bear it.","date":"2016-11-07 22:01:50","author":"William Sallomi","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trump-and-Clinton.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["Clinton","Donald Trump","election 2016","Hillary Clinton","Politics","Trump","voting"]},{"id":125467,"title":"Paly students: Who&#8217;s voting and why","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/07\/paly-students-whos-voting-and-why\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2016 presidential election will no doubt go down in history as one of the most intense, controversial and chaotic elections in the history of the United States, but also as one of the most important national decisions. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Americans are tasked with choosing between presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, both of whom have run campaigns riddled with scandals, leaving some voters with an extremely difficult decision to make.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_43954\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"478\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/2012-11-06-08.09.12.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-43954\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/2012-11-06-08.09.12.jpg\" alt=\"Voters wait in line inside Palo Alto High School's Tower Building to cast their vote.

Within just weeks \u2014 and in some cases, days \u2014 of turning 18 years old, a few lucky juniors and seniors have the chance to utilize their newfound rights and leave their mark on this year's election.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For senior Tanner Newell, who turned 18 this past September, the decision to vote was difficult. He ultimately decided against voting in both the presidential and local elections. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m not going [to vote],\u201d Newell said. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough time and I have other responsibilities.\u201d\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Newell emphasized that if he did find the time to vote come Nov. 8, he still would not participate in the local elections, because he will be moving out soon.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf I do vote, it will just be to the presidential,\u201d Newell said. \u201cI'm not going to be in Palo Alto for the local elections to affect me.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many eligible Paly students have decided to vote in the local and presidential elections this Tuesday.\u00a0<\/span>Senior Matthew Seto credits his duty to vote in both elections to his time as a Boy Scout.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs Boy Scouts, we were taught about a duty to our nation, and voting was one of those obligations,\u201d Seto said. \"It helps determine the future of your local community, as well as [the nation's.] Getting youth to vote is also very important as voting turnout in California is lower than the national average.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeto emphasized that this specific election was not the basis of his decision to vote.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I still would have voted, regardless of the candidates or propositions on each ballot,\u201d Seto said. \u201cEven though California is dominantly Democratic, each vote for a policy or candidate still carries weight and importance.\u201d\r\n\r\nOthers, like senior Ibby Day, feel that this presidential election is especially crucial to vote in.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm voting because this election matters to my future, and my peers' futures. Every vote does count, especially in this election,\u201d Day said. \u201cI'm voting for Hillary Clinton because I respect her as a candidate, and my political priorities align with her priorities the most. The President is essentially the most powerful person in the world, and to think that Trump, someone who is careless with his words and actions, might be in a position to make crucial decisions is absolutely terrifying.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenior Ethan Bundy also feels\u00a0that voting is essential, despite the unlikelihood of his candidate winning in California.\r\n\r\n\"Although I know my vote most likely won't make a difference because my political views are the opposite of approximately 99 percent of the people in California, I am still going to vote because people have died to give me the right to do so and in a lot of countries around the world people don't have that right, so I think it is disrespectful for people not to give their vote,\" Bundy said. \"Also, I am not voting for Hillary because I cannot vote for someone who is supposed to uphold the law when time after time she exhibits behavior that shows she believes she is above the law.\"\r\n\r\nMany view voting as a good way to remain informed about politics.\r\n\r\n\"Before I vote, I have to be reasonably well versed in current politics,\" senior Brian Tracy said. \"This is good information to stay up to date on and it allows me to have interesting discussions with my friends.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for other students, it only takes a small incentive to motivate them to get to the polls on Nov. 8.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI'm just looking forward to voting so I can get the \u2018I voted\u2019 sticker,\u201d senior Andrew Vargha said.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"Within just weeks \u2014 and in some cases, days \u2014 of turning 18 years old, a few lucky juniors and seniors have the chance to utilize their newfound rights and leave their mark on this year's election.","date":"2016-11-07 17:47:52","author":"Maya Reuven","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/2012-11-06-08.09.12.jpg","categories":["Election 2016","News","Spotlight"],"tags":["18","Andrew Vargha","brian tracy","Clinton","day","donald","election","election 2016","ethan bundy","hilary","ibby day","local elections","matthew seto","President","presidential","propositions","seniors","Seto","student voters","Trump","Vargha","voting"]},{"id":125512,"title":"The education argument \u2014 why students should support Clinton","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/06\/the-education-argument-why-students-should-support-clinton\/","content":"In a presidential election torn between unpopular candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, many voters will be holding their noses as they vote or won\u2019t be voting at all. This is especially true for younger demographics, who have the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2016\/05\/16\/478237882\/millennials-now-rival-boomers-as-a-political-force-but-will-they-actually-vote\">lowest voter turnout rates<\/a> in the nation. While the candidates\u2019 policies have been largely overshadowed by political scandals and heated bickering, their views on primary and higher education will no doubt have lasting impacts on American students.\n\nClinton\u2019s education plans, while flawed, provide much greater benefits to students and most Americans as a whole. Trump\u2019s plans, on the other hand, will degrade the public school system and have limited effects on nearly all\u00a0college students.\n\nClinton is pursuing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hillaryclinton.com\/issues\/college\/\">bold and expensive plan <\/a>on making higher education more accessible. According to her website, her top priorities include making community college free, funding minority-majority colleges and assisting student parents. Most notably, she plans to make public colleges tuition free for families with incomes at or below $125,000 by 2021. On the topic of student debt, Clinton has proposed cracking down on predatory schools and lenders, cutting loan interest rates and offering a three-month moratorium on student loan payments to federal loan borrowers.\n\nClinton\u2019s plans will no doubt be an asset to lower-income families who cannot afford to send their children to college as well as to students buried in debt. Her plans have also earned her the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aft.org\/resolution\/endorsement-hillary-clinton\">endorsement<\/a> of the American Federation of Teachers union. By making college more accessible to all students, her plan will greatly increase the number of students completing some form of higher education.\n\nThe main problems with Clinton\u2019s plans are cost-related. According to the higher education writer and political analyst Kevin Carey, Clinton\u2019s original education plan, based on making community college free, was economically feasible. However, after adopting many of Bernie Sanders\u2019 policies,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/07\/20\/upshot\/the-trouble-with-hillary-clintons-free-tuition-plan.html\">her new plan became extremely expensive and would reward states that spend the least money on students.<\/a>\u00a0An increase in tax rates on the wealthy would likely be needed to fund her ambitious program.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has no specific plan on student debt or even college in general. His claim that the federal government shouldn\u2019t profit from student loans is a positive statement but far from the set\u00a0of policies that America needs. In September,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/articles\/life\/inside_higher_ed\/2016\/09\/what_is_donald_trump_s_plan_on_college_affordability.html\">he revealed his goal <\/a>of pressuring academic institutions with large endowments to spend more on students or lose their tax-exempt status. This would be a helpful action for some college students, but only for those who attend universities with multi-billion dollar endowments. Moreover, it is impossible to judge Trump\u2019s plan for college education because he doesn\u2019t even have one outside of the two simple statements outlined above.\n\nTrump\u2019s primary education plans are significantly better than his college education plans, but that isn't saying much. An enthusiastic proponent of \u201cschool choice,\u201d Trump believes that students should be able to attend any school they wish, public or private. This policy choice is interesting and could have the power to improve the educations of lower-income, minority students. However, it carries some significant flaws. Though Trump has touted such plans time and time again, he has never specifically stated how he will finance the $20 billion initiative. Given his opposition to raising taxes, the costs would likely either add to the federal debt or result in cuts to other parts of the current education budget.\n\nSchool choice also furthers the degradation of public schools by taking money away from the public school system. Furthermore,\u00a0because many private schools are religious, allowing\u00a0tax dollars to pay for private schools that subscribe to a particular faith is a blatant violation of the constitutional separation of church and state,\u00a0according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publicschoolreview.com\/blog\/the-ongoing-debate-over-school-choice\">Public School Review<\/a>.\n\nTrump\u2019s opposition to Common Core is a plus, as its standards are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernjournalism.com\/common-core-fundamental-flaws\/\">not based on sound research<\/a> and\u00a0have resulted in<a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernjournalism.com\/common-core-fundamental-flaws\/\"> lower test scores<\/a>, according to Western Journalism. However, the United States president has no power to repeal these standards, as they were adopted at a state level, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/ed\/2016\/09\/25\/494740056\/donald-trumps-plan-for-americas-schools\">NPR<\/a>. Furthermore, ending Common Core is not a magical solution to America\u2019s education problems. By basing nearly his entire education platform on denouncing these standards, Trump is ignoring issues plaguing American students that are not affected by the Common Core, such as nationwide achievement gaps and student debt.\n\nClinton\u2019s K-12 plans, on the other hand, are probably more expensive yet simultaneously more far-reaching. While Trump\u2019s school choice would push students to leave public schools, Clinton aims to go to the root of the problem by improving public schools themselves. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hillaryclinton.com\/briefing\/factsheets\/2016\/02\/18\/ending-the-school-to-prison-pipeline\/\">Her website outlines specific policies <\/a>on elevating the quality of teaching, investing in run-down schools and helping each student learn computer science. When compared to Trump\u2019s simple viewpoints on K-12, Clinton's plans help combat a broader range of education problems.\n\nUnfortunately, Clinton has never stated how she will finance these new plans, and given the billions of dollars she has pledged to invest in this area, it is unlikely that simply reprioritizing the current budget will allow her to pursue these policies. As a result, Clinton\u2019s extensive K-12 education plan will help students at the expense of higher taxes on the upper class\u2014a consequence that is arguably relatively minor as it\u00a0will likely affect few people.\n\nClinton\u2019s policies have their own expensive flaws, but they greatly outweigh Trump\u2019s college and K-12 education plans\u00a0as they actively attempt to limit student debt and address primary education problems ranging from run-down schools to teaching quality. In the end Americans will have the final say: By casting a vote, we will\u00a0choose either debt reduction and college accessibility or a bleak future for students.","excerpt":"Clinton\u2019s education plans, while flawed, provide much greater benefits to students and most Americans as a whole while Trump\u2019s plans will degrade the public school system and have limited effects on most college students.","date":"2016-11-06 20:34:17","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Screenshot-2016-11-06-at-4.01.42-PM.png","categories":["Election 2016","Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","Clinton","college","Community","donald","education","election","Hillary","K-12","Trump","University"]},{"id":125463,"title":"Football clinches spot in CCS with victory over Mountain View","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/06\/football-clinches-spot-in-ccs-with-victory-over-mountain-view\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Palo Alto High School football team (4-6, 3-3) is preparing for its first game in the Central Coast Section playoffs after it defeated the Mountain View Spartans (5-5, 2-4) on Friday night, earning the Vikings a spot in the playoffs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a tough loss to Los Gatos High School (7-3, 6-0) on Oct. 21, and a bye week, the Vikings bounced back and beat the Spartans.

Veenker stated that her top three priorities are securing the water supply, increasing education funding, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nVicki Veenker, a Palo Alto High School parent, well-respected attorney and member of the Silicon Valley Law Foundation, believes that her prior knowledge representing low-income individuals and uniform support from environmental leaders will lead to success in Sacramento, despite her lack of elected experience.\r\n\r\nShe is running for District 24 against Palo Alto City Council member Marc Berman to replace retiring assemblyman\u00a0Rich Gordon.\r\n\r\nAccording to Veenker, if elected, her top three priorities would be reducing greenhouse gases through aggressive petroleum and energy regulations, securing water supply through agriculture subsidy reductions and conservation and increasing education funding through commercial tax increases, income tax extensions and lower sentences for non-violent offenders.\r\n\r\n<strong>Education<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to improve consistently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/education\/article\/California-s-school-system-ranked-9th-worst-in-6410633.php\">low-ranked California education<\/a>, Veenker has a lofty multi-pronged approach.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we spend $8,000 per student, when the national average is around $11,000, that is embarrassing for a state like ours,\" Veenker said. \"We have to reduce class sizes by attracting good teachers and hiring and retaining them.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe is also in support of universal pre-kindergarten and STEM education and upholding\u00a0the role of charter schools, but with the need for more accountability and transparency.\r\n\r\nThese extensive education plans come at a huge cost, which has forced Veenker to propose\u00a0a number of tax raises. She wants Prop. 55 or the extension of income taxes (without the sales tax increase), a split role for property taxes where only commercial property taxes are raised and saving money through criminal justice reform.\r\n\r\nVeenker expressed concern about the achievement gap in schools and offers a slightly different approach than her opponent. She believes that although the local funding control formula is a good start \u2014 which\u00a0gives extra allocation of funds for English learners and low-income students \u2014 there needs to be a continued monitoring of the districts that receive that money.\r\n\r\nVeenker conveyed problems with University of California\u2019s reliance on out-of-state enrollment, partially stemming from her daughter\u2019s own experience. She wants to shift the share of educational costs from 30 percent covered by the state to 80 percent.\u00a0She did not, however, express a specific funding source for these goals.\r\n\r\n<strong>Criminal Justice<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLike her opponent Marc Berman, Veenker wants to see the death penalty repealed.\r\n\r\nVeenker has made the phrase \u201ceducation over incarceration\u201d a major plank of her campaign. On the issue of criminal justice reform, she supports \u201crealignment from jails and reducing the length of non-violent offenses.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe has supported marijuana legalization in the past, calling it \u201cinevitable,\" but believes in regulating it \u201cat least like alcohol or tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Veenker did not express any specific marijuana regulations she wants included, she did advocate for learning from other states along the way. She also\u00a0expressed great concern in how law enforcement assesses\u00a0sobriety, because technology does not currently exist to assess marijuana intoxication in real time. One of her main reasons for supporting legalization is to reduce jail sentences and to stop illegal marijuana farming in state parks.\r\n\r\n<b>Environment<\/b><strong>\u00a0and Climate Change<\/strong>\r\n\r\nVeenker has made climate change a major issue of her campaign and says her differentiating factor is her \u201cuniform support by environmental leaders for my campaign.\"\r\n\r\nShe is in support of requiring 50 percent of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030 and reducing petroleum use as well to cut greenhouse emissions by 50 percent by 2030. Veenker additionally wants to continue the landmark cap-and-trade program in California.\r\n\r\nVeenker said she she believes in both a residential and agricultural approach when addressing the water issue in California.\r\n\r\n\u201cConservation is great but I don\u2019t think that will get us all the way to where we want to go on this issue,\" Veenker said. \"We should decrease the subsidization of water prices to farmers, which they aren\u2019t going to like at the get-go.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt that we should \"subsidize their adoption of this sort of water-saving technology.\" Veenker also believed that California should channel money towards Silicon Valley to research innovative ways of saving water.\r\n\r\n<strong>Affordable Housing<\/strong>\r\n\r\nVeenker supports a more aggressive approach to affordable housing but has some reservations about some of the currently proposed models. She supports a state housing bonds and tax incentives to encourage affordable housing, a one-time spinoff of the budget surplus to fund housing projects and wants a more regional approach to housing. She did not support requiring where and how much a municipality has to build.\r\n\r\n<b>Infrastructure<\/b>\r\n\r\nGovernor Jerry Brown\u2019s high speed rail project has become a controversial issue as the costs have increased by 50 percent and obstacles have grown, according to The Economist. Veenker supports an extremely modified version of the high speed rail while her opponent is fully opposed to it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Veenker, her main concern is the increase in costs, which has pushed up estimates by 50 percent. Instead of connecting the high speed rail to San Francisco which she feels is futile, she wants to see it blended into the Caltrain at San Jose with a \u201ccommon platform.\u201d While not stating outright opposition to the high speed rail, she stated that she wants to see \u201ca new plan and appropriate oversight to make sure we do better this time in living into the plan.\u201d\r\n\r\nVeenker wants to use some of these high speed rail savings combined with bond measures and tax increases to help solve the Bay Area\u2019s gridlock.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a crisis in transportation right now, today, in the Bay Area and we have to get busy fixing that,\" Veenker said. \"We are starting to with the measures in Santa Clara County, the half cent sales tax, helping electrifying Caltrain and getting BART down the East Bay.\u201d\r\n\r\n<b>Follow the Money<\/b>\r\n\r\nCampaign finance has become a hot issue in Sacramento with various reform bills going in front of the assembly, the most notable being the DISCLOSE Act. According to the Secretary of Election\u2019s official site, Veenker has received the largest donations from the Silicon Valley Progressive Women for Equity and Oportunidad Supporting Vicki PAC (near $200,000). The <a href=\"http:\/\/opensecrets.org\/pacs\/pacfaq.php\">PAC<\/a> is comprised of $25,000 from both the Consumer Attorneys of California Independent Campaign Committee and the Commercial Workers Western States Council Independent Expenditure PAC.

According to Berman, his top three priorities are education, housing and infrastructure. Photo: Chirag Akella.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marc Berman, a Palo Alto High School alum, attorney by training and current Palo Alto City Council member, plans to use his breadth of political experience to represent the 24th District if elected to the State Assembly on Nov. 8.<\/span>\r\n\r\nBerman is running against Vicki Veenker, a fellow attorney by training, for the open\u00a0spot in the 24th District that will be vacated by retiring assemblyman Rich Gordon.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Berman, his top three priorities are\u00a0minimizing\u00a0the achievement gap by funding statewide\u00a0preschool, creating more affordable housing by implementing a statewide affordable housing bond and improving infrastructure. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Education<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an attempt to address the current achievement gap in California, Berman hopes to fund preschool to help low-income children enter kindergarten at the same level of their more affluent peers. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201dI think it starts with preschool,\u201d Berman said. \u201cNinety percent of a child's brain develops before they turn five,\u00a0but they start kindergarten at five\u00a0years old, so low-income children are starting kindergarten 18 months behind their more affluent peers here in Santa Clara County. I think that universal preschool for all four-year olds is critically important, starting with low-income four-year olds. Expanding learning opportunities for youth from birth to three is going to be critical to closing the achievement gap.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berman also expressed concern for the lack of in-state students being accepted into the University of California system in recent years. He plans to focus on increasing the accessibility to the UC system for California students. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was talking to the chancellor of UC Santa Cruz about this,\u201d Berman said. \u201cAnd he said \u2018Let's take a wholesale review of the master plan for education, which promised accessibility to an affordable high quality education for California students who qualify.\u2019 We still have the high quality part but we don\u2019t have the affordable and accessible. We definitely need to revisit it.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With plans to create more educational opportunities for students, Berman recognized the need for additional funding. Despite not citing any specific parts he would address, he said he plans to reform the current tax structure to create more tax revenue.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think there\u00a0really needs to be a broader look at our tax structure as a whole to identify how much funding we want,\" Berman said. \"We need to\u00a0identify a tax structure that is as stable as possible so that every year we generate money as close to that as possible without the wild swings that we currently get.\"\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Campaign Finance<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaign finance has become an big issue in this campaign, as Berman's opponent, Veenker, and many others, including congresswoman Anna Eshoo, have voiced concerns over the amount of donation money Berman has received from special interest groups. Despite significant donation money\u00a0from a realtors group, Berman said that the enormous sum won\u2019t sway his policies and priorities, insisting that the group's major priorities align with his. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The three issues that the realtors really care about a lot, which align with mine, are education, housing, the need for smart growth, housing supply and infrastructure because the better the parks,\u00a0the better the community and the higher the house values are,\" Berman said. \"My platform just very well happens to align.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Affordable Housing<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To combat rising house prices, Berman hopes to involve the state in the funding process with an affordable housing bond to help non-profit organizations like Palo Alto Housing attempt to make housing more affordable.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"We need a statewide affordable housing bond,\" Berman said. \"They [Palo Alto Housing] need funding from numerous different sources including the state. Right now, San Mateo County and Santa Clara County have affordable housing bonds on the ballot. That is great, but the state needs to do likewise to really be a partner to solve our problem in affordable housing deficit.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berman also voiced his disapproval of rent control, a topic\u00a0supported by his opponent. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"A place where my opponent and I disagree is on rent control,\" Berman said. \"I don\u2019t support rent control and I definitely support increasing the supply of housing. I think that is what we need to do to stabilize rental rates and hopefully bring them down a little bit.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Infrastructure<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berman stressed the importance of improving California's infrastructure and promised to allocate resources to fix it. To raise the funds needed to undergo such projects, Berman cited multiple proposed taxes, including one on electric vehicle owners.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Sen. Jim Bell, who is a state\u00a0senator for San Jose and surrounding areas, has put forth a short-term proposal that gets funding from a variety of different methods,\" Berman said. \"One is increasing the gas tax which hasn\u2019t been increased in a couple of decades and another is increasing the vehicle license and registration fees a small amount. Also, I believe having a fee of 100 dollars a year for EV owners is totally viable and reasonable to help collect money. Long-term, I believe we need to have a vehicle miles traveled system to help get taxes to repair\u00a0our roads. It will take some upfront money, but it will save us money if we get our roads up to high quality.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nBerman additionally\u00a0supported a split role tax plan to prevent property taxes from rising while still bringing in tax revenue from commercial property.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I support a split role, which would be having commercial property, assessed on a more regular basis and not changing it for regular property, because that would have a detrimental effect on a lot of seniors on fixed incomes,\" Berman said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Bullet Train<\/b>\r\n\r\nBerman also discussed his concerns with Gov. Jerry Brown's\u00a0current plan to build a bullet train for transport from Los Angeles to San Francisco and expressed a desire to focus on local transportation first.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t support the bullet train as it is right now because I think we need to address our regional transportation problems,\" Berman said. \"In 12, 14, 16 or 18 years from now, I believe that we will have better technology to get us from San Francisco to Los Angeles and so I think we have to focus on helping people get from Alameda to Palo Alto.\u201d\r\n\r\n<b>Death Penalty<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berman expressed a desire to\u00a0move towards incarceration and away from the death penalty, citing issues such as mistakes, cost and length of time. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt [the death penalty] takes a long time, it is expensive and I think that life without the possibility of parole is a legitimate punishment for people who have done terrible crimes,\u201d Berman said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Marijuana Legalization<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berman is in favor of marijuana legalization, as he hopes that being able to regulate it can lead to more tax revenue and fewer sales to younger demographics. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI do support the legalization of marijuana because I think we are better off regulating it, taxing it and enforcing it,\" Berman said. \"Let\u2019s legalize it so that we make sure only people who are 21 and older can purchase it in a well-regulated climate.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Water Supply<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water conservation has become a hot topic in California with the prolonged drought.

While administrators at both Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School have spoken in favor of adopting Supt. Max McGee\u2019s proposed district-wide policy of reporting unweighted GPAs only, many students and parents have vehemently argued against it, on the grounds that such a policy disadvantages students for certain merit scholarships and represents an infringement on student freedom.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tuesday night, the Board of Education <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/02\/board-votes-for-weighted-on-mid-year-transcripts-for-class-of-2017\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">passed a motion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to change the GPA reporting practice for the Class of 2017 at both Paly and Gunn - seniors who are currently in the midst of the college application process. For the mid-year report that will be sent to colleges, both the unweighted and weighted GPAs will be recorded on transcripts.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first glance, this may seem like a simple solution; reporting weighted GPAs eliminates any risk, however infinitesimal it may be, of a student being disadvantaged for scholarships. Additionally, weighted GPAs will emphasize the AP and honor classes that students take and supposedly give them the appropriate credit for challenging coursework. But what is ostensibly a straightforward solution will in reality open up a Pandora\u2019s box of other issues, and we urge community members to critically consider the long term repercussions.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Considering the consequences<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin, the practice of reporting weighted GPAs will almost certainly reinforce the excessively competitive academic culture that has become associated with Palo Alto. Weighting GPAs will encourage people to take AP- and honors-heavy course loads, at the expense of regular lane and\/or elective classes. Furthermore, since Paly and Gunn offer far more weighted STEM classes than humanities and social science classes, the practice of reporting weighted GPAs in effect diminishes the value of non-STEM courses. And alarmingly, reporting weighted GPAs is just a step away from ranking students, either formally or in a de facto manner, because weighted GPAs make it far easier to delineate between students\u2019 GPAs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The programs that board members have touted as examples of educational innovation, such as Advanced Authentic Research, the Social Justice Pathway and the journalism program, as well as performing and visual arts classes, will likely see declining enrollment as a result of the GPA decision. When forced to compete with peers and choose between programs that will add to their overall high school experience or boost their GPA, many will choose the latter.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the recording of weighted GPAs on transcripts could exacerbate another dogged problem in our district: the achievement gap. Only relatively wealthy students will be able to afford the outside tutoring for honors and AP courses, or off-campus instruction that allows them to accumulate more weighted credit, creating an even larger chasm between the privileged and the underserved in our community.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concern about the practice of weighting GPAs harming our most vulnerable students isn\u2019t a hypothetical one; it is very much grounded in anecdotal evidence. Because most weighted GPA methodologies do not take into account classes such as Living Skills and Physical Education, students who have earned high grades in those courses but have struggled in academic core classes may have lower weighted GPAs than unweighted GPAs. At the board meeting on Tuesday night, Paly Principal Kim Diorio reported that the administration has identified approximately 50 Paly students for whom this is the case. These students are disproportionately ethnic minorities, come from low-income families and have Individualized Education Programs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weighted GPAs also present a whole host of logistical issues and unnecessary confusion. For the updated reports that will be sent out to all schools students have applied to early, in addition to the mid-year reports that will be sent out for the Class of 2017, Paly will adopt the UC\/CSU methodology to calculate students' GPAs, while Gunn will be sticking with the algorithm it has been using for the past several years. Though board members claimed they prioritized standardizing practices between the two schools, their proposal doesn\u2019t even address the problem: there is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a disparity between Paly and Gunn. And if the schools were to continue weighting students\u2019 grades, what weighting methodology would they employ? Would they use the UC system, which doesn\u2019t consider many underclassmen honors classes for weighted credit and caps students to a maximum of eight semesters of weighted courses? Or would they devise another methodology, that would ultimately be arbitrary because colleges recalculate GPAs on their own? This is just a small sampling of the never-ending stream of questions that would arise.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Dispelling fictions<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though we are concerned about the effects of this decision on our school climate, we would like to emphasize that current seniors should not be concerned about the change in GPA reporting practices affecting their chances for college applications.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College admissions officers across the nation will unequivocally say that your transcript is considered within the context of your high school, and obviously, a Paly student\u2019s unweighted GPA is not being compared, from a purely numerical standpoint, with another applicant\u2019s weighted GPA. At the most recent school board meeting, proponents of weighted GPAs presented evidence that seemed to show that students with weighted GPAs receive a boost in college admissions. But those sources are misleading, because information was selectively cherry-picked. And significantly, our college counseling professionals and various admissions officers have told us the complete opposite: they state that high schools' GPA reporting practices do not have bearing on students' chances for acceptance.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addresses to the school board, some people have mentioned the scholarship opportunities that students will be deprived of if the district does not report weighted GPAs. We strongly believe that the district should do everything in its capacity to help students procure financial aid. However, it is nonsensical to use merit scholarships as a justification for changing the GPA practice because administrators have yet to find a college that will not accept a letter vouching for a student's weighted GPA in place of it on a transcript. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of a Paly student missing the GPA cutoff for a merit scholarship at the University of Oregon because her unweighted GPA was reported, Kim Diorio contacted an admissions officer at Oregon and resolved the issue; the student is now eligible to receive the scholarship. According to Diorio, the admissions representative did not want Paly to change its GPA reporting policy for one student, and as such, Oregon has agreed to accept letters from Paly and Gunn administrators vouching for weighted GPAs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, many in the pro-weighted GPA camp have said that reporting unweighted GPAs de-incentivizes students from challenging themselves academically. But this cannot be true, because many people at Paly and in general have taken difficult class loads knowing full well that only their unweighted GPAs will be reported to colleges. What reporting weighted GPAs could do, however, is compel students who aren\u2019t prepared for or interested in the content of AP classes to take them, and further contribute to a hyper-competitive academic atmosphere.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Moving forward<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The choice to report weighted GPAs is a drastic one, and likely irrevocable; we believe it will be near impossible to revert to the old system if the district elects to formally adopt reporting weighted GPAs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most appalling part about this decision is that students and parents were assured in writing that nothing would change for this college admissions cycle, and the school board, in unanimously voting to put weighted GPAs on our transcripts, has completely walked back on that promise. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A letter sent out to parents by the Parent Teacher Student Association on Oct. 13 stated, \u201cAs parents, we ask that you please share with your teen that for this school year, nothing will change. Anything about the issue will not affect the Class of 2017.\u201d Supt. McGee expressed similar sentiments in his weekly message published on Oct. 28, stating \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this year we are not recommending changing the current practices for grade reporting at either Gunn or Paly.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suffice to say, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">w<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e are deeply disappointed with the board members \u2014 who have run on platforms of promoting student wellbeing \u2014 for ignoring the recommendations of professional educators and proceeding with a motion that has the potential to increase stress among the student body. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The extremely abrupt school board decision also failed to follow previously established norms of evaluating both sides of the issue prior to making tangible changes. In the past, PAUSD has spent months forming committees, fostering discussion and reviewing board reports when making a decision affecting students. It is shocking that the board did not follow the same procedure in considering the GPA issue \u2014 what should have been a thoughtful and comprehensive evidence-gathering process became a rushed political maneuver to satiate the demands of an aggressive lobby.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while this hasty short-term proposal has been agreed on for this year's senior class, it is not too late for the district to reevaluate this decision and thoroughly examine the consequences that this will have on the culture of Palo Alto high schools for years to come.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve worked so hard, for so long, to fundamentally address the issue of student stress across Palo Alto schools. We take great pride in our community but far too many of us have felt the effects of a suffocatingly competitive environment\u00a0that overemphasizes academic achievement and contributes to a reduced sense of self-worth.\u00a0The practice of r<\/span>eporting weighted GPAs\u00a0is a multifaceted issue that has the potential to affect our school culture \u2014 and it certainly deserves\u00a0more than the cursory consideration it received.\r\n\r\n<i>Editor's Note: To avoid a conflict of interest with his involvement in this issue, The Paly Voice's adviser disengaged himself from the writing of this editorial.
