Junior Cezanne Lane, an organizer of CIOS Week and Associated Student Body spirit commissioner,\u00a0was also\u00a0taken aback by the hateful comments.\r\n\r\n\"This is really shocking for a community that I thought was so progressive,\" Lane said. \"Hopefully the person who did it didn't mean it, but those words are harmful.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Dami Bolarinwa said he is disappointed by the graffiti. According to Bolarinwa, the Black Lives Matter movement carries an important message that people need to hear.\r\n\r\n\"That's truly heartbreaking to see that people have reverted to such disgrace of integrity,\" Bolarinwa said. \"Black lives and many minority lives are targeted, so it saddens me to know students at Paly feel that way and are continuing to target students on campus with vandalism as this.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Sergio Valente said he believes the messages do not represent the values of the Paly student body.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I saw the graffiti I assumed that the people who created it were just doing so as a joke and thought it was funny,\u201d Valente said. \u201cI think there are many better ways to express juvenile fun and it\u2019s sad that they chose to do so in a way that can be offensive.
