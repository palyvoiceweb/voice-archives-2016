According to the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.registermychapter.com\/tsa\/teams\/reg\/staterank.aspx?A=teams1516\">results<\/a> released to coaches on Monday, Paly's underclassmen team placed sixth overall, the upperclassmen B team placed first and the A team placed fourth.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough our main goal at the competition\u00a0was to try to make it to the national conference, we certainly did not expect to make first\u00a0in the state, of which I'm very proud of our team,\u201d junior B team member Stefan Quach said.\r\n\r\nThe underclassmen competed against 21 other teams, and\u00a0the upperclassmen teams competed against\u00a036 other teams. All three teams have been preparing for the state competition since November, according to Hong.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had study meetings about twice a month, where each member would research one of the eight topics covered in this year's competition and practice the first part of the competition,\u201d Hong said.\r\n\r\nAccording to the TEAMS's\u00a0official <a href=\"http:\/\/teams.tsaweb.org\/\">website<\/a>, the nationals competition consists of three parts: an essay, a presentation and an event called \u201cproblem solving.\u201d The top\u00a0ranked team for each level in each\u00a0state will receive\u00a0a 'Best in State' banner for its school, medals for the team members and a certificate.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe essay is due two weeks before the actual competition; it involves researching a certain topic and making a certain decision, such as investing in specific biofuel-related technologies, which was last year\u2019s topic,\u201d Hong said. \u201cThe presentation is similar but is delivered on site. Last year the topic was rebuilding cities struck with a natural disaster using renewable energy.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe problem-solving portion involves both a build event and a set of questions related to eight topics, according to Hong.\u00a0The eight topics are pumping systems, failure engineering and materials science, genomics, lenses and telescopes, microscope technology, semiconductor materials, six sigma manufacturing methods and space exploration.\r\n\r\nThe club hopes to retain its previous rankings and improve its ranking in the problem solving portion, according to junior co-president Samarth Venkatasubramaniam.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast year, we got second in essay, sixth in presentation and seventh overall,\u201d Venkatasubramaniam\u00a0said. \u201cIn the upcoming months, we'll be writing our essay and then we will research and practice for the other two events.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the club is only in its second year, Hong says he believes it will continue to grow and members will gain valuable experience competing in competitions with real-world topics.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">\u201cHopefully the introduction of a club like this will allow even more students to explore STEM [Science Technology Engineering and Math] and investigate topics that aren't taught in a typical science class,\u201d Hong said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe national competition will take place from June 28 to July 2 in Nashville, Tennessee.","excerpt":"Three teams of Palo Alto High School students are preparing to attend the nationals competition this summer after placing at the TEAMS (Test of Engineering Aptitude in Math and Science) state competition on Feb. 27.\r\n","date":"2016-04-14 11:13:00","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/teams-pic.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["competition","daniel","hong","Jerry","nationals","palo alto high school","paly","samarth","states","stem","teams","venkatasubramaniam","zahra"]},{"id":118987,"title":"ASB elections for Treasurer and Junior VP take place on Thursday, April 14 and Friday, April 15","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/13\/asb-elections-for-treasurer-and-junior-vp-take-place-on-april-14-and-april-15\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-04-13 22:14:46","author":"Chirag Akella","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":118817,"title":"ASB announces majority of team for 2016-17 school year","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/13\/asb-announces-majority-of-team-for-2016-17-school-year\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_118953\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"620\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/12312469_481970981983406_483221451_n1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-118953\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/12312469_481970981983406_483221451_n1.jpg\" alt=\"Paly's ASB poses for a photo during a meeting.

Paly is covering the broken windows with plywood while waiting for the out-of-stock replacements to arrive.\r\n\r\nThe administration is analyzing the extent of the damage before deciding on\u00a0a penalty, according to Berkson. The perpetrators, currently unidentified, could face legal consequences and pay upwards of $1000 in damage. Other repercussions may include suspension, a permanent addition to a student\u2019s record that could affect their college eligibility, says Berkson.\r\n\r\nThe administration may take further legal action, as a BB gun was brought on\u00a0campus.
