They had to deal with change and they bought into what we are trying to accomplish.\"\r\n\r\nA highlight of the season included defeating the Wilcox Chargers (5-6, 4-2) during a regular season league matchup. The Chargers went on to finish second in the De Anza League.\r\n\r\n\"They were the No. 1 team in the league at the time and we won,\" Schilling said. \"That was one of the best games in my playing career.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' finished fourth in the De Anza League, which secured them a spot in CCS playoffs.\r\n\r\nDespite the early CCS loss, Vikings' first year head coach Danny Sullivan looks forward to next season.\r\n\r\n\"In my first year at Paly, there were some definite challenges by being a new face to the area,\" Sullivan said. \"I am thankful that the school and the players that stuck it out through the season welcomed me to be a part of the program. There were some lows, along with some very big highs for our team this season. Definitely some things that the kids coming up through the ranks can build on for next season.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings look to make a mark next year by starting preparation for the 2017 season soon.\r\n\r\n\"Workouts in the weight room to build strength and conditioning are going to begin in late January,\" Sullivan said. \"We have a goal to show people how much we can improve from one season to the next. In talking with many other coaches around the area, the word is out about how we do things here at Paly. They all know that if the work gets put in, we are a team to be reckoned with in 2017.\"\r\n\r\nAccording the Schilling, the future of Paly football looks promising.\r\n\r\n\"I really think the team as whole improved week to week,\" Schilling said. \"This year was tough because we had to learn a whole new offense and adjust to a new system.\"\r\n\r\nThe team will depend on the talents of sophomore quarterback Jackson Chryst, junior running back Paul Jackson III and junior lineman Bryant Jefferson for leadership in the coming season.\r\n\r\n\"Our program can take drastic strides next season if junior Bryant Jefferson can continue to improve and if sophomore Jackson Chryst can grow as a player on the field,\" Sullivan said. \"If those two have a successful offseason, the rest of the team will follow their lead.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Football team wrapped up its season with a 4-7 overall record and 3-3 league record after a loss to the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (8-3, 6-0) in the first round of the Central Coast Section playoffs.","date":"2016-11-21 21:27:46","author":"Noah Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/los-altos-v-pa.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports"],"tags":["CCS","danny sullivan","football","jackson chryst","jordan schilling","palo alto","Paly football","recap","season","Sullivan","vikings"]},{"id":126113,"title":"Season Preview: Girls basketball seeks to avenge last season&#8217;s early NorCal exit","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/21\/season-preview-girls-basketball-seeks-to-avenge-last-seasons-early-norcal-exit\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115295\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"386\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/julie-jumpman.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-115295\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/julie-jumpman.jpg\" alt=\"Junior forward Julie Chandler leaps in the air as she goes up for an acrobatic layup against Gunn late in the fourth quarter on Friday at Gunn.

The girls team fell to Dublin High School Gaels, 55-49, in the first round of NorCals.\r\n\r\nSenior and fourth year guard Lauren Koyama hopes to put last year's early NorCal exit behind her, and is ready to start the season this winter.\r\n\r\n\"Getting eliminated early definitely hurt last year, but right now we are focused on getting through preseason and league.\" Koyama said. \"We want to peak in February, and we just have to take it one game at a time.\"\r\n\r\nLed by seniors Koyama and Skylar Burris, the team is looking to fill the gaps left by last year's seniors: Maddy Atwater, Alexis Harris, and Courtney Lovely.\r\n\r\n\"We lost three starters last year, one of them being our main source of height on the court. In order to adapt we need to work hard for every rebound and bring the energy that our seniors last year brought [to] every game,\" Burris said.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Harris will have the largest impact on the team, as she led the team in both scoring and rebounding last year, according to Maxpreps.\r\n\r\n\"We have a lot of guards who are capable of making threes, which can make up for the loss of our post scoring.\" junior guard Carly Leong said. \"We need to be more physical when it comes to rebounding, because we are a smaller team, and physicality will make up for it.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the loss, the girls team \u00a0maintain their dominance, having eight of the eleven players returning to the team.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only major change to the program is how many new players we're bringing in. The past couple years we've been playing with basically the same team, and I think bringing some players up from JV and new underclassmen trying out will give us a new dynamic.\" Leong said. \"So far, every practice has been so much fun, and I can't wait for season to start.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe season starts at 7 p.m tonight, with the Vikings traveling to St. Ignatius.","excerpt":"After a 1st place finish in the Central Coast Section (CCS) playoffs and a first round NorCal loss, the Palo Alto High School girls' basketball team looks to return to CCS finals.","date":"2016-11-21 17:20:28","author":"Kasra Orumchian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/julie-jumpman.jpg","categories":["Basketball","Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","basketball","girls","girls basketball","gunn","palo alto","palo alto high school","paly","season preview","sports","vikings"]},{"id":126411,"title":"TEDx club to hold student speaker auditions","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/21\/tedx-club-to-hold-student-speaker-auditions\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_126417\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/10922448_334598283407783_150521601487457039_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-126417\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/10922448_334598283407783_150521601487457039_n.jpg\" alt=\"TEDx's 2015 conference.

Photo from Imdb.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the production of its most recent film, \"Dr. Strange,\" Marvel brings a new side of superheroes to life, one that goes beyond the classic confines of conventional superpowers to introduce themes of mysticism and the occult. In the tradition of superhero movies, \"Dr. Strange\" is action packed, fast paced and pushes the envelope of visual effects to make a fantastical and unreal world come to life.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While all Marvel movies may emphasize mesmerizing imagery and exciting battle choreography, to the point of cookie-cutting plots and sacrificing dialogue, \"Dr. Strange\" doesn\u2019t quite fit the mold as closely as some of the previous installments. Superhero movies may be as Hollywood as it gets, but the film, along with Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as the titular character are distinguished with wittier lines, clever plot tricks and an eclectic musical score that give the audience more food for thought as it takes a surreal detour from Marvel's usual path.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe concept of an astral body, different dimensions and the ability for the mind to heal the body are explored with \"Dr. Strange,\" replacing the conventional superpowers in previous installments. The movie\u2019s depiction of these spiritual ideas is unfortunately shallow, as the thin layer of eastern-inspired practices covers up a lot of mystical mumbo-jumbo. That being said, the theme of humility and respect to a universal power is a repeating theme in the movie where egotistical Dr. Strange is humbled by its might, in a way that may allude back to eastern religious themes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie starts by introducing Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), \u00a0a brilliant and dexterous neurosurgeon from New York who's as arrogant as he is meticulous. The doctor\u2019s life is suddenly met with tragedy when he is victim to a car accident that leaves him severely damaged in both his hands. With his surgical career hanging on the line, Strange desperately seeks a cure, eventually traveling to Kathmandu, Nepal, after hearing of a miraculous case where a man overcame paralysis in the mysterious, secret compound of Kamar-Taj. What he finds there he cannot fully accept.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When the mysterious overseer of the compound, the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), introduces Kamar-Taj as a magic academy, both audiences and Dr. Strange are skeptical of what to expect, only to be literally blown away by her demonstration of mystical ability. The producer\u2019s decision to embrace the original story\u2019s eastern notion of sorcery created the opportunity to depict vivid Kaleidoscopic scenes of morphing buildings and psychedelically changing landscapes, breathtakingly bewitching when watched on an 80-foot screen. In the compound, Dr. Strange is taught how to manipulate and distort reality, the power of teleportation and altering time, in scenes that are reminiscent of classic sci-fis like \"<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Matrix\"<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and \"<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inception.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind the whimsy and excitement of the wondrous powers, an evil is emerging that threatens Kamar-Taj and the whole world. Dr. Strange and the compound\u2019s guardians, Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Wong (Benedict Wong) must defend\u00a0humanity from the evil ex-student, Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), who seeks revenge on the Ancient One by opening a gate to the \u201cDark Dimension\u201d.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Strange\u2019s own past unfolds as his journey returns him to his home city of New York and the very hospital he used to perform in. He rekindles things with his former romantic partner, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) who desperately tries keeping him alive as Strange\u2019s ghostly, astral body does dimensional battle with a dark sorcerer. The relationship between Strange and Christine develops throughout the course of the movie, as dynamically as the warping environments so expertly created through special effects.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important criteria for a good superhero flick is the wow factor of the battle scenes. The fighting sequences are less destructive than the usual arena-like melee duels of previous superhero movies, and more focused on disorienting and out-maneuvering the enemy. Dr. Strange may fight in or out of his body while the battlefield may jump from different corners of the Earth to different dimensions. Viewing the characters contest the streets of New York\u00a0and Hong Kong to other dimensions was especially spellbinding up-close in theaters with an intense original soundtrack adding to our immersion.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is certainly one movie worth seeing on a big-screen in theaters. The storyline was fast paced and engaging while the action was dazzling. Watching formulaic brawl scenes where opponents always use brawn can become very repetitive and tiresome, but \"Dr. Strange\" was a refreshing new breathe from Marvel\u2019s predictable past.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nRunning Time: 115 minutes\r\n\r\nDirector: Scott Derrickson\r\n\r\nCast: Benedict Cumberbatch-Stephen Strange &amp; Dormammu\r\n\r\nRachel McAdams-Christine Palmer\r\n\r\nTilda Swinton-The Ancient One\r\n\r\nMads Mikkelsen-Kaecilius\r\n\r\nChiwetel Ejiofor-Karl Mordo\r\n\r\nBenedict Wong-Wong\r\n\r\nMusic Composer: Michael Giacchino\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"In the production of its most recent film, &#8220;Dr. Strange,&#8221; Marvel brings a new side of superheroes to life, one that goes beyond the classic <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/17\/dr-strange-is-a-strangely-enticing-supernatural-adventure\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2016-11-17 18:22:51","author":"Donnesh Farmanfarmaian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/doctor-strange-cumberbatch-magic-powers.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Spotlight"],"tags":["Dr. Strange","film","marvel","movie review"]},{"id":126248,"title":"Verbatim: Vikings share motivations for attending peace march","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/17\/verbatim-vikings-share-motivations-for-attending-peace-march\/","content":"Palo Alto High School students joined others from around the Bay Area in a peaceful demonstration Tuesday afternoon at downtown Palo Alto.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration was intended to spread messages of love and acceptance, and was inspired by the unrest that many students felt because of derogatory comments made during the 2016 presidential election.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice asked students why they decided to attend the march.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.thinglink.com\/card\/855323001644646402\" width=\"700\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School students joined others from around the bay area in a peaceful demonstration Tuesday afternoon at downtown Palo Alto.
