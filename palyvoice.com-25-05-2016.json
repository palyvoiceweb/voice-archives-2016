Photo by Nika Woodfill.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis week the Paly Voice sat down with music enthusiast and Vikapella member senior Jenny Xin, to discuss pop music, her perfect pitch and choir.\r\n\r\nXin has participated in choir for all four years of high school, but claims it has not influenced her music taste substantially, despite its importance to her musical education.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy music taste is independent from choir,\u201d Xin said. \u201cHowever, choir has exposed me to a lot of new ideas musically, and stylistically, and I\u2019ve kind of learned what makes the songs I like listening to catchy. And kind of been able to learn about popular music throughout the ages. Even though I don't listen to a lot of the songs we sing in choir it is definitely really interesting to learn about them and perform and that has definitely broadened my musical horizons.\u201d\r\n\r\nOver the course of Xin\u2019s musical career, she has been able to develop something called perfect pitch.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo perfect pitch is generally like being a glorified tuning fork,\u201d Xin said. \u201cBasically perfect pitch or relative pitch means just being able\u00a0to identify notes by their name, so if you hear the letter C or E or A flat you'll be able to hear that note in your head.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the talent that stems from having perfect pitch, Xin explains that it is more of an annoyance when it comes to listening to music.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gets kind of annoying. It\u2019s not really a help as much as it is a giant pain,\u201d Xin said. \u201cI\u2019ll listen to a radio station and sometimes they'll pitch their songs to avoid copyright issues and so I can kind of realize that it annoys me the whole time.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Xin, she most enjoys listening to high tempo upbeat songs, however, her individual music taste is difficult to categorize.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of the songs I listen to are so different I'm not really sure what the underlying theme is,\u201d Xin said.\" For me, it is to an extent lyrical but also the production behind the song. But mostly I tend to like really upbeat catchy music.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Xin described how her music preference has evolved in high school.\r\n\r\n\u201cI used to think listening to mainstream pop was kind of a guilty pleasure thing, but I think I enjoy more now without too much shame, and I have gotten more into musicals,\u201d Xin said. \u201cMy music taste has definitely developed. Before I would mostly be listening to classical or pop music but now I listen to everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aclairekrugler%3Aplaylist%3A3Z3oH0xrxcXRUJQij2AQbv\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"This week the Paly Voice sat down with music enthusiast and Vikapella member senior Jenny Xin, to discuss pop music, her perfect pitch and choir. <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/24\/tuesday-tunes-jenny-xin\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2016-05-24 23:31:31","author":"Claire Krugler","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/DSC_00081.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Spotlight","Tuesday Tunes"],"tags":["choir","Jenny Xin","music","perfect pitch","Tuesday Tunes","vikapella","wombats"]},{"id":120788,"title":"Students to perform music on the Quad during lunch","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/24\/students-to-perform-music-on-the-quad-during-lunch\/","content":"Student musicians will be performing on the Palo Alto High School Quad during lunch\u00a0as part of this week's program hosted by the Associated Student Body.\r\n\r\nThe performances will include\u00a0original pieces and covers, according to ASB School Board representative senior Emma Cole. Many genres of music will be represented, including\u00a0rock, alternative, rap and hip hop.\r\n\r\nASB is putting on this event to alleviate some of the stresses of finals week, according to\u00a0Cole.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe just wanted to put this event on because we love seeing Paly students relaxing and enjoying free time on the Quad, even when school is stressful and hectic,\u201d Cole said. \u201cIt is nice to just take a break on the Quad on a beautiful sunny day and listen to great music. It is a very low key, calm event, but hopefully students will just see it as a chance to wind down and relax a little bit.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the past, the Paly band has performed on the Quad, however, ASB expanded the event to allow for student musicians to play, according to Cole. Students\u00a0from a variety of musical backgrounds signed up to perform in front of their peers and show off their talent.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis week\u00a0gave us a reason to get a group together and try playing some styles of music we do not usually play,\u201d senior Peter Willits said. \u201cWe are using this week of music as a method to spread some music to people who may need it and hopefully to get some people dancing.\u201d\r\n\r\nWillits and his band will be playing covers of reggae, ska and funk songs.\r\n\r\nOther hope that this week will help bring some publicity to their work.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to perform because I have been writing and producing original songs for years and want this to help me get more exposure,\u201d senior Martin Manasherob said. He will be performing a series of\u00a0hip-hop and rhythm and blues songs, all self-written and produced.\r\n\r\nManasherob says he hopes\u00a0that his music will help students relax and have fun.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that this will be good for the campus because it is music that gives off a good vibe,\u201d Menasherob said. \u201cIt [the music] is positive for people who might be having a tough day or maybe just want to enjoy some good music.\u201d\r\n\r\nBelow is the tentative list of performance dates, according to Cole.

They completed an undefeated regular season by finishing 14-0 overall heading into the postseason. According to captain junior Timothy Liu, the Vikings cruised into the CCS finals with a lot of confidence, but were unable to execute.\r\n\r\n\"We played very well at Leagues and CCS Regionals, which led up to last week's CCS championship,\" Liu said. \"Unfortunately, we didn't play as well as we would have hoped during the CCS championships and we were eliminated from the competition sooner than we would have liked.\"\r\n\r\nLiu attributes the Vikings' success to senior leadership and a consistent group of underclassmen.\r\n\r\n\"I'm still incredibly proud of how well we played as a team this year,\" Liu said. \"The seniors really held their ground and anchored the team and a talented group of sophomores kept the team's engine churning all year long.\"\r\n\r\nTeam captain, senior Henry Gordon, who has committed to playing golf at Occidental College, agreed with Liu, saying that he excited about where the team currently stands.\r\n\r\n\"It feels good to cap off four years confidently knowing that we are one of the top public teams in the state,\" Gordon said.\r\n\r\nHead coach Doyle Knight will look to build off of this season's strong performance. The Vikings will be led next year by Ali, Liu and sophomore Sergi Mata, among others.\r\n\r\n\"Next year, we're looking to keep up the overall positive season we had this year and hopefully turn the tide during CCS and win it all,\" Liu said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' golf team officially concluded its season on Monday when sophomore Ahmed Ali missed the cut for the state competition by one stroke at the NorCal Golf Championships in Salinas.","date":"2016-05-24 14:28:52","author":"Josh Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/13184547_1720898391485755_1901.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["#norcal","ahmed ali","boys' golf","CCS","doyle knight","henry gordon","matthew lewis","season recap","timothy liu"]},{"id":120508,"title":"Buy a seat in the Performing Arts Center","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/24\/buy-a-seat-in-the-performing-arts-center\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_120511\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"587\"]<img class=\"wp-image-120511\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/PAC.jpg\" alt=\"PAC\" width=\"587\" height=\"393\" \/> The Palo Alto High School Performing Arts Boosters are currently selling seat nameplates in the new Performing Arts Center to raise funds to purchase additional amenities that were not included in the building costs.

We are also soliciting direct donations and donations in any amount are greatly appreciated. We plan to install a donor recognition wall in the lobby of the theater [which will include names of donors who contributed over $100].\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the large effort required to fundraise, Ward is\u00a0excited for the future of the PAC.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was Theater Boosters president from 2007 to 2011 and my daughters both loved theater,\u201d Ward said. \u201cWhen I learned that a group of parents had raised funds for the Media Arts Center, I felt compelled to help raise funds for the PAC and I want to see it through to the end and make sure that it will provide a first class setting for the outstanding performing artists at Paly.

He worked for the Environmental Protection Agency and as a wildlife biologist prior to teaching. Photo by Dhara Yu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jack Kearns points out an oak tree located on the edge of Palo Alto High School's campus Quad. \u201cIt reminds me of a baobab,\u201d he says, referring to the bizarre-looking tree that graces the savannas of Africa, and spouts off a few facts about that plant. To most onlookers the tree is unremarkable,\u00a0but to Kearns, Palo Alto High School's new Advanced Placement Environmental Science teacher, it's evocative of\u00a0the Serengeti and worthy of more than a cursory glance.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing well over six feet tall, with the burly frame of an ex-football player, Kearns is\u00a0genial and outgoing \u2014 he\u2019s the type to give a vigorous wave to passing students and staff, or start up a game of volleyball on the Quad\u00a0after school. It\u2019s not hard to see why the administration thought him a suitable replacement for Kenyon Scott, the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/22\/trust-and-respect-remembering-kenyon-scott\/\" target=\"_blank\">beloved Paly AP Environmental Science teacher<\/a> who suddenly passed away in January.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to go forward with Kenyon\u2019s mantle, to follow in his shadow, to carry on what he had started,\u201d Kearns\u00a0said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kearns\u2019 path to Paly was certainly a serendipitous one. He was working toward his teaching certification when one of his professors in teaching school informed him that there was an opening at Palo Alto High School in environmental science, which would be his first full-time teaching job \u2014 he soon connected with Paly administration and interviewed for the position. But to Kearns, the logistical details are irrelevant.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat matters is that this came together at the right moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided to become a teacher because I felt a calling, from a higher power, and I finally had the opportunity to follow that voice.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kearns keeps a folded envelope in his pocket, scrawled with the quote, \u201cMay God give you entrance to the hearts of those you teach, and then make you know that as you enter there, you stand in holy places.\u201d His teaching philosophy, he says, is to imbue his students with a sense of respect and reverence for the natural world by keeping his class lighthearted and enjoyable, and relating environmental science to their daily lives. As the final assignment for his class, students created chalk drawings with slogans underscoring the importance of preserving the natural world.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"He's very interested in active learning, and having his kids get out and experience the environment,\" said science department instructional supervisor Kelli Hagen about Kearns.\u00a0\"Whether it's on-campus field trips, which he's done a lot of, or off-campus, he wants his students to be engaged.\"\r\n\r\nJunior Mason Wittman, one of Kearns' students, echoes this sentiment, underscoring Kearns' commitment to instilling an admiration for the outdoors\u00a0in his students.\u00a0\"It's not just in the classroom,\" Wittman said. \"We get to go out, and I've really developed a passion for environmental science. I might even pursue it.\"\r\n\r\nBut Kearns himself has realized that his style of education may\u00a0be at odds with certain\u00a0perceptions\u00a0of the community\u2019s tradition of academic rigor. \u201cI sense an academic intensity here,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge to reconcile that.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kearns brings with him an extensive background in ecology \u2014 he\u2019s worked as a wildlife biologist and for the Environmental Protection Agency. His career has\u00a0taken him across the world, to\u00a0the Mojave Desert, the Alaskan glaciers, East Africa and Japan. The plains of Kenya and Tanzania, in particular, hold a special place in his heart.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe landscape was my favorite part,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSitting in the Serengeti \u2014 which means endless plains, it just extends forever, as far as the eye can see \u2014 and watching a lightning and thunder storm. Images like that were my favorite \u2014 just taking everything in and being in awe.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His specialties as a wildlife biologist, Kearns says, are the small carnivores of Africa and birds of prey.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf anyone has a question about mongooses or raptors, they can ask me,\u201d he said\u00a0with a laugh.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Kearns, as he describes it, lives and breathes environmental science, he also has an avid interest in sports.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI played football, basketball, rugby, volleyball, beach volleyball, martial arts, swimming, you name it,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s actually how I got to college, on a football scholarship. I\u2019ve coached on and off for the last ten years.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kearns is very much a family man: he is married, with a 15-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old son. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSpending time with them is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mucho, mucho divertido<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d he said, invoking a bit of Spanish. When asked\u00a0about his foreign language ability, he said he knows a few words of Swahili, Tongan \u2014 he played on a Tongan rugby team \u2014 and Japanese.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He keeps mementos from his cultural experiences, and on his first day of teaching at Paly he brought in two: a warrior's club and a lion's tooth,\u00a0given to him by a\u00a0nomadic Maasai tribe in the Serengeti.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"To become a Masaai warrior, you have to kill a lion,\" Kearns said. \"It's not about animal cruelty. It's about demonstrating that they can protect their family and their tribe.\"\r\n\r\nAs the school year draws to a close, Kearn's future at Paly remains\u00a0uncertain \u2014 his teaching contract with the district goes only through this academic year\u00a0\u2014 but he has clearly earned the respect\u00a0of many his students.\u00a0It's no easy task to stand in as\u00a0a replacement for a teacher, particularly one who was so universally admired, but according to Wittman, Kearns has done so seamlessly, bringing his own experiences into the fold while maintaining the buoyant, optimistic spirit that has characterized this class.\r\n\r\n\"I think Paly did a great job,\" Wittman said. \"They probably found the best possible replacement. We all loved Mr. Scott, but I think everyone loves Mr. Kearns too.\"\r\n\r\nAnd without a doubt, that appreciation is reciprocated, says Kearns.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cI am living the dream. This is my dream job.\"<\/span>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice profiled AP Environmental Science teacher Jack Kearns, who spoke about his athletic prowess, expertise in small African carnivores and passion for teaching.","date":"2016-05-24 10:37:31","author":"Dhara Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/kearns.jpg","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":["AP environmental science","apes","ecology","environmental protection agency","Jack Kearns","Kenyon Scott","what is a mongoose","wildlife biology"]},{"id":120766,"title":"Gunn students plan sit-in; teacher salary decision looms","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/23\/gunn-students-plan-sit-in-teacher-salary-decision-looms\/","content":"Students at Gunn High School are planning a sit-in protest at Tuesday night's school board meeting.

Students received this information several weeks after taking their tests, requiring them to review and study once again even as final tests and projects begin to pile up.\r\n\r\nGunn senior Ben Lee is one of the students affected by this.\r\n\r\n\"I have to retake a three-hour AP Lit [English Literature] test and write three essays again,\" Lee said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lee, the sit-in is an attempt to get students a voice in these situations, and to hold the Gunn administration responsible for its errors in proctoring.\r\n\r\n\"I'd say it's to show the school board and general community that students want to be heard and students are visibly affected and care about this issue,\" Lee said. \"A main goal is to get the administration to actually be held accountable and for the school board to take some action regarding the procedures of administering APs and also how the administration functions.\"\r\n\r\nStudents have also put forth a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/the-gunn-administration-the-annulment-of-final-assignments-for-2016-gunn-school-year\">petition<\/a>\u00a0asking for flexibility with final projects and tests. According to Gunn junior Aidan Lilani, most teachers are fairly receptive to accommodating students' needs.\r\n\r\n\"Most teachers have been really chill,\" Lilani said. \"They've been making finals optional or just lowering the work load.\"\r\n\r\nThe AP mess only serves to reignite tensions between the Gunn students and administration. According to Lilani, the tension comes from the Gunn administration making significant changes to the Gunn system without student input.\r\n\r\n\"I would say there has been tension since they have been making a bunch of changes last year,\" Lilani said. \"First would have been the schedule change, and then getting rid of zero period.\"\r\n\r\nSchool board member Terry Godfrey says the students have made a major step forward by organizing themselves to protest the problems.\r\n\r\n\"I think the students have shown a lot of maturity by being clear through the petition what their expectations for a solution are,\" Godfrey said. \"This is a really tough situation for the students; the mistake was unfortunate but not deliberate and I imagine it will result in more solid procedures for the proctors going forward.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the school board agenda, Supt. McGee will address the AP retake situation in his superintendent's report.\r\n\r\nTeacher salaries are also a topic of debate at the meeting. The school board will vote for a plan that would enact a 5 percent salary raise retroactively from July 2015, a 4 percent raise for the 2016-17 school year, and a 3 percent raise the following year. The plan also institutes bonuses depending on property tax growth.\r\n\r\nAccording\u00a0to Godfrey, the salary change should not be seen as a \u201cmoney grab by teachers.\u201d Several board members pointed to the importance of attracting high-caliber teachers and the high cost of living in the area as rationale for the salary raise.\r\n\r\nThe school board meeting starts at 6:30 p.m Tuesday at the district office.","excerpt":"Students at Gunn High School are planning a sit-in protest at Tuesday night's school board meeting.

Then there\u2019s thudding footsteps, wolves and a boy in a red loincloth named Mowgli. Mowgli\u2019s entrance is fast-paced, with darting camera angles that track his running through beautifully animated trees. The action-based start sets up the tone of the movie and lets the audience know that this is much more than a children's movie.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"The Jungle Book,\" directed by Jon Favreau, follows closely to the original 1967 movie. The tale follows the young man-cub Mowgli who was raised in amidst wolves and swinging vines in the vast jungle. The adventure begins as Mowgli is forced from his home by the tiger Shere Khan and has to run away from the wolf clan that raised him. It's a story about friendship, about man's relationship to nature and most prominently the story of this young boy as he discovers his place in the world.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike the Disney\u2019s animated 1967 version of \"<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Jungle Book<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\" this version takes a decidedly large turn towards the darker and sinister side of this coming-of-age story. Social commentary is subtly weaved throughout Mowgli\u2019s adventure, as he not only faces the \"eat or be eaten\" policy of the jungle, but also how mankind is a threat to the environment with the invention of fire. This new movie is a beautiful CGI rendition of the original that is worth seeing. <\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_119991\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"308\"]<img class=\"wp-image-119991\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/junglebookcast2_zpsjjcigkuo.jpg\" alt=\"junglebookcast2_zpsjjcigkuo\" width=\"308\" height=\"219\" \/> Actor's Scarlet Johanson and Christopher Walken pose with their CGI charter counterparts in a promotional shoot for the \"The Jungle Book\" Movie. Photo courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a sinister and disturbing, chaotic nature to the jungle that accompanies Mowgli\u2019s adventure in the new movie. The jungle is equal parts dangerous and beautiful and through enchanting CGI, Favreau is able to artfully maneuver us through its tangled vines, majestic beasts and dark corners. The iconic scene where Mowgli is trapped by the breathy, seductive voice of Kaa, the gigantic python voiced by Scarlett Johansson, perfectly encapsulates the ominous atmosphere of the movie. The choice to switch Kaa\u2019s voice to a woman really enhanced the spine-tingling atmosphere and hypnotic sequence. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sizes of the animals in the movie are blown out of proportion. Sometimes they were twice, three times or even ten times their actual size (we\u2019re looking at you King Louie \u2014 way to scare the kids). The size of the animals serve to encapsulate the \"child's view of the world\" which we see through Mowgli's eyes. Mowgli\u2019s view of the world warps our perception of reality. Although sometimes the enormous quality of some of the animals is enjoyable, King Louie\u2019s disgusting folds of skin are a bit excessive.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The live actor in the movie, is 12-year-old Neel Sethi who plays the character of Mowgli. For a child actor, Sethi does an excellent job of portraying the emotion of a scared but also fearless boy who lives in the jungle. From outrage to confusion his facial expressions are convincing, from outrage to confusion, and he manages to seem serious and childishly humorous at the same. His acting takes the point across; this is a boy that is loyal to his friends and family and will do anything he can to stay in the jungle. Of course, \u201canything\u201d always means more trouble.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_119989\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"221\"]<img class=\"wp-image-119989\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/The-Jungle-Book-Special-Shoot-BAGHEERA-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"The-Jungle-Book-Special-Shoot-BAGHEERA-683x1024\" width=\"221\" height=\"332\" \/> British film star Ben Kingsley sits next to the CGI panther Bagheera who he voices in the film. Photo courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Mischief comes in the form of a honey-seeking, carefree, grizzly bear by the name of Baloo. And who better to play the voice of Baloo than Bill Murray? The singing bear is\u00a0perfect comic relief for what could have otherwise been an overly dark movie. If a voice could ever be cantankerous, Murray is the one to pull it off. The song \u201cThe Bear Necessities\u201d makes an entrance, but in a\u00a0non-obtrusive way - just enough of a snippet to give a nod to the old song. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other song featured in the new movie is \u201cI Wanna Be Like You,\u201d sung by famous actor Christopher Walken as King Louie. Walken\u2019s raspy voice is perfect for the haunting\u00a0spin put on the classic song.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new film keeps the narrator of the story, the panther Bagheera, voiced by the smooth and polished voice of Ben Kingsley. A perfect posh voice for an uptight panther.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The Jungle Book\" movie presented the perfect blend of beautiful CGI and amazing voice work. The new movie masterfully renewed the original by adding a significantly dark sinister atmosphere. We recommend the movie to anyone wishing to rediscover this childhood classic, revisit classic songs and discover a sinister yet gorgeous CGI jungle.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"In the opening minutes of the film, a scene of a jungle filled with tangled vines and blooming flowers unfolds before our eyes.

Photo: Adrienne Kwok.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nApproximately 75 percent of Palo Alto High School juniors opted out of the Smarter Balanced test on Tuesday and Wednesday.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had roughly 25 percent of the students show up,\u201d Assistant Principal Adam Paulson said. \u201cIt seemed like it was a little bit less this year. \u2026 We\u2019ve done these [California Standardized] tests for many years, and we\u2019ve never got this non-turn out before. I guess we\u2019re [admin] trying to grapple with why people are opting out.\u201d\r\n\r\nCalifornia Education Code \u00a760615 permits students to opt out of California tests if their school receives a note of excuse from their parents. Last year about 50 percent of juniors <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/27\/where-is-everyone-students-opt-out-of-smarter-balanced-test\/\">opted out of the SBAC<\/a>.\r\n\r\nWith such a small number of student participants, the administration will not be able to receive an accurate score of how the student body is performing academically.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need a 95 percent threshold to get a score for the school to get accurate data, which obviously we didn\u2019t hit,\u201d Paulson said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Paulson, the administration can do little to ensure that students take the test.\r\n\r\n\u201cObviously we want more kids to participate, but a lot of it is out of our hands,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural thing. Students don\u2019t see the benefit in it [the SBAC].\u201d\r\n\r\nLast week, Principal Kim Diorio <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/16\/smarter-balance-testing-to-begin-tomorrow\/\">encouraged students<\/a> to take the test via a Schoology message.\r\n\r\n\"Smarter Balanced Testing is a low stakes assessment for students but a high-stakes test for our high school and it's state-wide and national rankings, as well as being the primary source for school-wide data to inform our WASC continuous improvement process,\" Diorio wrote.\r\n\r\nJunior Dani Macuil says she opted out of the test as it occurred shortly after Advanced Placement exams and a few weeks before final exams.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to Smarter Balance testing because I felt like it was unfair to ask students to do another week of testing on top of APs and getting ready for finals,\u201d Macuil said. \u201cI also knew that 95 percent of students wouldn\u2019t show up; therefore, it would be pointless to go anyways because it still wouldn\u2019t meet the requirements.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Lydia Miller, her class experienced\u00a0several technical issues on the first day of testing.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost of the computers didn\u2019t have it [the exam] on there,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe had to go from computer to computer to see which had the test on it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the test, classes partook in discussions about the parts of a coffee cup to help solve math equations about a cup. On the second day, English teachers conducted a discussion about the definition of poetry and prose before starting the exam. While some students found the introduction helpful, others including junior Isabella Bernard found the discussions unhelpful in solving the problems and said they only wasted time.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [the discussions] weren't\u00a0even relevant to the problems,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to know any of it to do the problems.\u201d","excerpt":"Approximately 75 percent of Palo Alto High School juniors opted out of the Smarter Balanced test on Tuesday and Wednesday.","date":"2016-05-19 22:29:35","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/13225152_1706672769592750_1831332758_o.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["balanced","exam","sbac","smarter","test"]}]
