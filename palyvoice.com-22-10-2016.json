The Paly administration recently released a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1dgRurvVuzDXtwWqByW2LQgKYiFhHWuQ84r_lCxhSteY\/edit\">statement<\/a> reaffirming its current practice, stating that reporting weighted GPAs is not conducive to fostering a healthy school climate.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nAmid concerns from students and parents that this practice disadvantages students currently in the\u00a0college and merit scholarship application process, the Board decided to take up the issue for discussion earlier than the originally scheduled date in January.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PAUSD Supt.\u00a0Max McGee presented his\u00a0Two Point Plan for aligning the two high schools\u2019 grade reporting process, which stipulates that both schools would report only students\u2019 unweighted GPA on transcripts. In cases where colleges use weighted GPA as the criteria for merit scholarships, PAUSD would generate an official letter to the institution.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked by a Board trustee what the high schools would do in a situation in which a college would not accept a letter vouching for a student\u2019s weighted GPA, McGee responded by insisting that he would directly call the admissions department, eliciting an audible hiss from the audience.<\/span>\r\n\r\nOver 20 community members voiced their opinions on the issue during the Open Forum session, the overwhelming majority of whom argued in favor of reporting weighted GPAs. Paly senior Maya Katz, who pointed out to the Board at its meeting two weeks ago that not reporting weighted GPAs would disadvantage students for merit scholarships at certain colleges, most notably\u00a0the University of Oregon, urged the trustees to actively seek community input.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe need your [the Board\u2019s] support to get student voice and student opinion on the topic,\u201d Katz said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other student speakers echoed Katz\u2019s sentiments, emphasizing the need for administrators to listen to the student body. Gunn senior Asaf Katzir\u00a0spoke in defense of reporting weighted GPAs, explaining that he was depending on merit scholarships that consider weighted GPAs to help finance his college education. Parents underscored similar points in their addresses to the Board, with many saying that eliminating the option of reporting weighted GPAs constitutes a restriction on student freedom.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCan we just add a column with weighted GPAs [on the transcript]?\u201d Gunn parent David Hong implored the Board, drawing a rousing round of applause.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just four speakers, all of whom were Paly administrators, advocated for reporting only\u00a0unweighted GPAs. Paly principal Kim Diorio said she was surprised to see that no one from the Gunn administration attended the meeting to defend McGee\u2019s Two Point Plan, and that so many speakers decried eliminating weighted GPAs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI see this [standardized grade reporting practices] as an opportunity, but it sounds like it hasn\u2019t been framed that way with the Gunn students and parents,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cI hear a lot of fear and worry.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the Open Forum session, Board member\u00a0Camille Townsend argued forcefully in favor of reporting weighted GPAs, saying that it was \u201cterrible\u201d that students had to bring this issue to the board in the first place and that the district should not \u201cgerrymander the APs [Advanced Placement courses],\u201d by\u00a0failing to reflect\u00a0weighted classes in students' GPAs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While neither of them explicitly said no to reporting weighted GPAs, trustees\u00a0Ken Dauber and Terry Godfrey stressed the need to listen to professional educators in making the decision. Fellow Board member Melissa Baten Caswell expressed support for re-evaluating the grade reporting process such that weighted GPAs are included on student transcripts, but emphasized that the district must find a short-term solution for seniors who will be applying to colleges in the coming months.<\/span>","excerpt":"Emotions ran high at the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education meeting yesterday evening at the district office, where students, parents, school administrators and board trustees heatedly discussed the merits and disadvantages of including students\u2019 weighted grade-point-averages on transcripts for college applications.","date":"2016-10-19 23:15:25","author":"Dhara Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0979.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["college applications","gpa","gunn","paly","PAUSD","scholarships","School Board","unweighted","weighted"]}]
