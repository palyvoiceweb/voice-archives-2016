Photo: Jackson Doerr.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School Vikings football team (3-5, 2-2) is fighting for a spot in the De Anza league playoffs after losing its homecoming game against the Los Gatos Wildcats (4-3, 3-0), 35-6, last night on the Paly football field.\r\n\r\nThe game was an ordeal for the Vikings, who struggled to put\u00a0the Wildcats' strong offense on hold, throughout the entirety of the game.\r\n\r\nJust five minutes into the game, the Wildcats broke\u00a0through the Paly defense to score the first touchdown of the game.\u00a0The rest of the first quarter was a scoreless standoff, and the ball did not leave Paly's half.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter, Los Gatos gained 96 yards in ten plays over the course of two minutes and 12\u00a0seconds, and added another Wildcat touchdown to the scoreboard.\r\n\r\nOn the very next play, a player from each team was ejected for personal fouls, including Paly junior offensive lineman Bryant Jefferson.\r\n\r\nSullivan\u00a0said he disagrees with\u00a0the call and he believes that the skirmish was not grounds for ejection of either player.\r\n\r\n\"It was just an overreaction to the play,\" Sullivan said. \"I was looking at it the whole time and I don't think anybody should have gotten ejected, including their kid.\"\r\n\r\nLos Gatos would go on to score twice in the 3rd and once in the 4th, bringing the score to 35-0. But with three minutes left in the game, Paly was able to get a touchdown, preventing the Wildcats from securing a shutout win.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sullivan, Paly struggled with performing smaller plays.\r\n\r\n\"We started moving the ball but we hit a wall,\" Sullivan said. \"Simple execution on little things is the difference between the two scores so we've got to get better at doing that.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Sullivan, the Vikings will continue to focus on working the kinks out of their play.\r\n\r\n\"It's just doing the fine tuning that we really have to focus on,\" Sullivan said. \"We've gotten so much better over the course of the season and we're only going to keep getting better.\"\r\n\r\nSullivan said the season is far from over, and the Vikings are in competition for a spot in the playoffs.\r\n\r\n\"We're playing for a playoff spot in these next two weeks,\"\u00a0Sullivan said. \"Next week is a bye week. We need to get a couple things neatened up and then it's off to Mountain View.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Sullivan, the Week Nine bye is a blessing in disguise.\r\n\r\n\"We were\u00a0looking at it and Week Nine looks like the worst time for a bye,\" Sullivan said. \"[However,] It comes at a perfect time because we need to jump back on the horse.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will fight for a spot in the playoffs against the Mountain View High School Spartans (6-3, 3-2) at 7:00pm on Nov. 4 at Mountain View.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Vikings football team (3-5, 2-2) are fighting for a spot in the De Anza league playoffs after losing their homecoming game against the Los Gatos Wildcats (4-3, 3-0) 35-6 last night on the Paly football field.","date":"2016-10-22 16:56:02","author":"William Sallomi","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/los-altos-v-pa.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports"],"tags":["danny sullivan","football","paul jackson iii","sports"]},{"id":124911,"title":"Video: Spirit Week Day 5 ends with dazzling performances","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/22\/video-spirit-week-day-5-ends-with-dazzling-performances\/","content":"The Paly Voice documented the fifth and final day of Palo Alto High School's Spirit Week. \"Paly Spirit Day\" featured the exciting \"Hula Hoop\" race at the lunch rally, as well as the unveiling of class floats and class dance performances after school\r\n\r\nFinal scores for Spirit Week will be released today during the Homecoming dance at Gunn High School.

The final round between the two upperclassmen teams came down to the last second, but a last minute error from the juniors led to seniors to victory.\r\n\r\nJunior and Hula Hoop Chain participant Will Schmutz, though content with his team's overall performance, discussed what went wrong in the final round.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we had better executed our game plan, we would have beaten the seniors,\" Schmutz said.\r\n\r\nThe lunch rally ended with teachers breaking it down with their own prepared spirit dance. During their dance, however, a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/21\/streaker-disrupts-friday-lunch-rally\/\">streaker<\/a> ran across the football field and escaped into a getaway car.\r\n\r\nPer Paly tradition, Spirit Week concluded with an after school rally, where each grade presented a float and a spirit dance.\r\n\r\nSenior Tanner Newell expressed his pride in both his float and his class.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a lot of hard work, but I'm proud of how my class pulled together and made this amazing float,\u201d Newell said.\r\n\r\nWhile the final standings for the four floats are still to be determined, the senior class performed its winning dance during halftime of the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/21\/liveblog-homecoming-football-game-against-los-gatos\/\" target=\"_blank\">homecoming game<\/a>. The dance results for the remaining freshmen, sophomores and juniors have not yet been announced.\r\n\r\nAs of now, the current overall standings remain in grade order.
