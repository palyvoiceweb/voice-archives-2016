Photo: The Paly Voice.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Paly Voice sat down with Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education members Heidi Emberling and Melissa Baten Caswell separately to discuss their priorities if re-elected to the board and their views on significant community issues. Stay tuned for coverage of non-incumbents candidates of\u00a0the 2016 school board race.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>The Paly Voice<\/strong>:\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are re-elected to school board, what will your main priorities be?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Heidi Emberling<\/strong>: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Main priorities are high quality teaching and learning, investing in our teachers, who are the most important resource in the classroom and managing our resources for enrollment and everything else we want to spend money on at PAUSD.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Melissa Baten Caswell<\/strong>: My first priority is making sure that we have ways for every student to be engaged, actively challenged and learning. In order to do that, we need to have many different types of programs, not just sitting in the classroom and listening but we need to have internship programs and pathway programs. We need to invest in more flipped classrooms and blended classes. We\u2019ve invested in some classes that seem kooky almost but they have engaged a lot of students.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, I want to make sure that, with the teacher shortage, that we\u2019re investing different ways to keep our teachers, train them and develop them. We need to look regionally at how we\u2019re going to support our teachers and other service people that live in the community. We need to make sure that PAUSD is a great place to work.\u00a0The teachers have really the biggest impact on learning but we need to make sure that those teachers want to stay in PAUSD and if somebody offers them a job in a place where they can get cheaper housing or\u00a0maybe get paid a little more it\u2019s not going to be the thing that pulls them away.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third thing is, there\u2019s no point in doing all this investment if our students aren\u2019t ready to learn. We need to make sure that we\u2019re investing in the whole student and that means that their social, emotional and physical selves need to be strong and healthy. We need to realize that you don\u2019t just learn in the classroom, you learn on the playing field, you learn in the theater, you learn during internships, you learn during community service. I\u2019m a huge proponent in investing in the wellness centers that are in our high schools and I\u2019d like to see the wellness centers put in at the middle schools as well. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing is doing more innovative things in the classroom. We\u2019re going to have to give teachers more time to develop these innovative things. Ms. [Lucinda] Filppu couldn\u2019t have come up with Comedy Literature if we hadn\u2019t given her time to develop that class. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then this is not the most interesting thing, but we\u2019ve had a lot of people retire who knew how to do their jobs and they never documented it anywhere, and that\u2019s really a problem so I\u2019d like for us to invest in our system so that things are done a little more systematically. When I talk about that, I mean things like payroll, attendance, evaluation systems and maybe food services. So all these things, if we were able to make them more systemized, I think we could be more efficient, I think we could make everyone\u2019s jobs easier.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: What are your goals for continuing to address mental health problems that students may face?\r\n\r\n<strong>HE<\/strong>: W<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e opened a new wellness center which I\u2019m very happy about and we\u2019ve had a mental health specialist and we\u2019ve expanded services for teens around health and well-being. We\u2019ve added yoga and mindfulness and other ideas like that. It is of primary importance to me to provide educational experiences that meet the needs of students, focusing not only on academic achievement, but also on building skills that develop\u00a0a balanced, healthy life.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>MBC<\/strong>:\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One, we can\u2019t look at the school in a vacuum. We\u2019re part of a community and we have to be working with community resources as well.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other, we need to make sure that we have good services at school for students who need them. I call that a \u201cpainkiller,\u201d when we have a problem, we have services that are appropriate. We also need to work on what I call \u201cvitamins,\u201d and that is to give full and opportunities for students to work around stress and work with you know you make a mistake something went wrong what do you do in those types of situations. We have to make school a safe space to make mistakes because you\u2019re going to get out into the real world and you\u2019re going to make mistakes and there\u2019s gonna be repercussions and if you\u2019ve never had that happen to you, that could be a very traumatic thing. I want to make sure that we\u2019re investing in both sides, on the \u201cpainkiller\u201d side and on the other side as well where we\u2019re trying to create resiliency. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: Studies show students aren\u2019t getting enough sleep and starting school later may be beneficial. What is your opinion on starting school later?\r\n\r\n<strong>HE<\/strong>: I was in support of\u00a0\u00a0eliminating zero period [classes]\u00a0although\u00a0I know some students were not happy with that decision for this very reason. I think sleep is very important for healthy brain development and that we should start school at the right time for teens, which may not be as early as it is now.\r\n\r\n<strong>MBC<\/strong>:\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think if we didn\u2019t have to worry about things like sports and extracurricular activities and after school jobs, I\u2019d say \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s do that.\u2019 But we have a system that we have to work within, so what I would instead suggest is that we have different options that you can choose from. For example, you can take a blended learning class and some of these classes would be in the late afternoon or evening so you could take a prep in the morning. We have to offer some more flexible options and we have to allow students to choose what works with their lives.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: How do you believe PAUSD can change policies on student-teacher interactions after allegations of misconduct against teachers in the district?\r\n\r\n<strong>HE<\/strong>: We have put in place sexual harassment mandatory training for all of our teachers and we've also started to think about student training. We want to make sure that students know when to report when they're feeling uncomfortable around a teacher or another adult authority figure and who they can go to. We really want to work with the Student Council and ASB to see how better we can involve students in\u00a0raising awareness for this.\u00a0It is of paramount importance that our schools are safe for everyone.\r\n\r\n<strong>MBC<\/strong>:\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we can do a better job of documenting what\u2019s proper behavior and what\u2019s not proper behavior. We need to be careful when we do that though, because we do want teachers to be treating their students as if they\u2019re people. We do want to have some connectedness between the teachers and students\u2014just not inappropriate connectedness. I remember a few years ago there were some questions among the club teams who were playing sports in town about inappropriate behavior that happened when coaches were driving an athlete home and what came back was really that a coach shouldn\u2019t be alone with a player. And once that was documented and people were trained on that, then it just stopped.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A teacher shouldn\u2019t be in a classroom with a closed door and no windows even if they\u2019re giving special help to a student. I think we need to be careful though; we could whiplash ourselves into a situation where we have been so constricted with the rule that we can\u2019t have a good environment for interaction either. There are students who don\u2019t have adults in their lives that they can talk to and they have serious issues and sometimes a teacher is that person who you can talk to, and I\u2019d hate for that to go away. I would hate to have a teacher be afraid to talk to a student about a problem, for example.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: Many PAUSD teachers must drive hours each day to teach in Palo Alto. How do you believe the Board can help with addressing this issue?\r\n\r\n<strong>HE<\/strong>: Unfortunately the School District hasn't considered housing. What we can do is partner with the City of Palo Alto and confer with our regional partners to work on housing, housing affordability and availability. Mountain View is doing some interesting things with teacher housing and and we'd really like to partner with them around this issue.\r\n\r\n<strong>MBC<\/strong>:\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that this is a problem that is regional, by the way. It\u2019s not Palo Alto by itself; all the towns around it have the same problem, and I don\u2019t think the school district could do anything really meaningful by itself. So my suggestion is that we figure out how to get the city and the school district talking regionally, with other school districts and cities in the area, and talk about some regional solutions. One thing the superintendent was suggesting is that we have Google buses coming in from the East Bay. Maybe that\u2019s a short term solution, but that\u2019s not a long term solution for a lot of different reasons. If people aren\u2019t living in the community, then they\u2019re not a part of the community. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps for the school district to encourage programs for lower income housing. One of the things I asked assembly member Rich Gordon was \u2018Is there a way for anybody to create housing that is only for a certain group of people, like only for government employees, for example? Can you do it by law?\u2019 I don\u2019t know. These are the things we need to better understand so we can have some good solutions. It needs to be solved as a regional solution and this is also a longer term issue. Palo Alto has been getting more and more expensive for teachers and service people to live here and it\u2019s not just teachers, it\u2019s also policemen and firemen and other service workers as well. So I don\u2019t think we can look at it as teachers in isolation, I think we have to look at it all together.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education members Heidi Emberling and Melissa Baten Caswell to discuss their priorities if re-elected to the Board and their views on significant community issues.","date":"2016-09-22 21:26:47","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Screenshot-2016-09-19-at-8.47.28-PM.png","categories":["Election 2016","Features","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","Board of Education","election","heidi emberling","issues","melissa baten-caswell","palo alto","PAUSD","School Board"]},{"id":122584,"title":"Verbatim: Should marijuana be legalized in California?","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/verbatim-should-marijuana-be-legalized-in-california\/","content":"This November, <a href=\"https:\/\/ballotpedia.org\/California_Proposition_64,_Marijuana_Legalization_(2016)\" target=\"_blank\">Proposition 64<\/a> is going to be on the California ballot.

I just like having a positive attitude about everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vikings are excited for their next game against cross-town rival Gunn and plan to work hard during practice to improve upon their flaws, according to Hall.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAt the end there were a couple of sloppy passes that led to turnovers,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI think if we just work on maintaining stamina in the water then everyone can make those passes.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly\u2019s next home match is at 6:45 p.m. against Mountain View High School, Tuesday at Gunn.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"In a water polo double header against district rival Gunn Titans (3-1, 2-0), the Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 water polo team (4-5, 1-1) also lost, by a score of 5-2 yesterday at Gunn High School.","date":"2016-09-16 09:33:27","author":"Sam Lee","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/IMG_4533.jpg","categories":["Sports","water polo"],"tags":["girls","gunn","joanna falla","lady","paly","rival","rivalry","sabrina hall","talia stanley","titans","vikings","water polo"]},{"id":122497,"title":"Stolen Stanford golf cart appears on campus","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/15\/stolen-stanford-golf-cart-appears-on-campus\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_122498\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/IMG_2649.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-122498\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/IMG_2649.jpg\" alt=\"A stolen Stanford golf cart is sitting on the Palo Alto High School senior deck.
