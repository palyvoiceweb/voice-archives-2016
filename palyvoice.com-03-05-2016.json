Vander Schaaf says she likes Kasich, but supports Ted Cruz for president and had supported Marco Rubio until his campaign\u2019s suspension. While she supports Cruz because he is a very conservative candidate, Vander Schaaf believes candidate Donald Trump is negatively affecting the Republican party and is hoping for a brokered republican convention.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fcgzAISYBTE\r\n\r\n<strong>Peter Ohtaki:<\/strong>\r\nPeter Ohtaki is the former mayor and two-term city council member of Menlo Park, elected in 2010 and 2014.

We have diversified our economy. We are running surpluses.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Kasich, he was able to vastly improve Ohio\u2019s economy by cutting taxes, balancing the budget and using common sense. He says he plans to use similar methods to alleviate America\u2019s debt and increase prosperity.\r\n\r\nKasich also addressed his opponents\u2019 policies, implying that Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are threatening to divide the nation. He also stated that the Democratic candidates\u2019 economic promises are unrealistic.\r\n\r\n\"Here's what I tell young people: you can have all the free\u00a0you want but at the end of the day with the nation $30 trillion in debt, you might go to a free college but you won't be able to get a job,\" Kasich said.\r\n\r\nKasich\u2019s political viewpoints were woven into several anecdotes describing his early life growing up in a working class household in a Pittsburgh suburb and his encounters with prominent figures such as President Nixon and the president of his alma mater as a youth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever remember having met a Republican [in my hometown],\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI am a blue-collar son of a Democratic mailman. And thank goodness, because that has allowed me to be able to understand and relate to people at every level.\u201d\r\n\r\nCalifornia Assembly Republican leader Chad Mayes and California State Senator Jean Fuller were among several politicians who attended\u00a0the dinner to endorse Kasich.\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout question, John Kasich is the best candidate to have at the top of the Republican ballot,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cHe can launch the conservative reform efforts needed to restore our nation. He can unite the party and win the White House. He is prepared to be commander in chief on day one and he has the track record to prove it.\u201d\r\n\r\nFormer U.S. Senator Gordon Humphrey also attended the banquet to show his support for Kasich.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like the fact that he is superbly qualified by virtue of experience and success as governor of Ohio.\u201d Humphrey said. \u201cHe has a noble soul and a golden heart and is an extraordinary human being. I think he is well qualified for the office in terms of experience and also in terms of temperament. He is respectful towards others, unlike some of the other candidates who are most unpresidential.\u201d\r\n\r\nKasich is currently in third place in the Republican presidential primary with 153 delegates.

While the protest generally remained peaceful, several brawls broke out between pro-Trump and anti-Trump attendees, and metal barriers surrounding the hotel were removed by protesters hoping to interrupt Trump\u2019s speech inside the hotel.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dozens\u00a0of police officers were dispatched to the scene after crowds attempted multiple times to enter the building, first through the front entrance and side doors and later by crossing an overpass linked to the car garage.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, protesters\u00a0carried signs with angry messages including \u201cMr. Hate leave my state,\u201d \u201cTrump is a rapist and conman\u201d and \u201cDump Trump.\u201d Others played\u00a0musical instruments or form barriers by linking arms.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Veria, one of hundreds of protesters, says she attended the demonstration to show her children the importance of being civically involved.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s so easy right now to sit back behind your phone screen or to be on social media being upset about things, but to actually take action is important,\u201d Veria said. \u00a0\u201cWe want to lead by example. We feel very strongly that these are not the values we want our children to grow up on and that they [Trump\u2019s values] are dangerous for the type of world we trying to build together.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other protesters cited Trump\u2019s alleged sexism or racism as reasons for protesting.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI hate Trump,\u201d said Sheila, who declined to disclose her last name. \u201cI hate that he\u2019s fascist.

Do I look like a terrorist?\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many protesters were eager to express their anger. Attendees carried Trump pi<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00f1atas and threw eggs at Trump cardboard cutouts, while others threw eggs at the hotel windows and shouted expletives at police officers for committing \u201cpolice brutality\u201d after several protesters were shoved and arrested by officers for attempting to enter the building. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of Trump's\u00a0supporters bore signs condemning the protesters, resulting in some hostile confrontations.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palo Alto High School junior Andy Chang attended part of the protest and says that Trump remains popular because he can connect with conservative voters\u2019 deeper fears.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI agree with many Republican values, however, I do not support any Republican candidates. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are just disgusting human beings,\u201d Chang said. \u201cThe media said that people vote for Trump is because he is \u2018tapping into the fears\u2019 of the people, a \u2018successful\u2019 businessman having confidence of not being politically correct, and so on. Most of their reasons are accurate. I remember the first time the media criticized Trump because he said many illegal immigrants are criminals, drug dealers and rapists, and the US should build a wall for them. This speech is indeed very extreme. But the general idea of strictly protecting the U.S. border is not extreme.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The protest largely dispersed by 2:30 p.m., when the shrinking crowds were told to leave by police because of unruly behavior.
