Hull said that he was able to succeed thanks to an aggressive mentality on the mound. \r\n\r\n\u201cI felt pretty good,\u201d Hull said. \u201cI was ready. Playoffs are always fun. [I] just try to attack hitters.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly struck first with an RBI single by senior right fielder Owen Plambeck, allowing senior third baseman Riley Schoeben to score. \r\n\r\nThe Vikings continued to stretch the lead in the second inning with a triple by senior Lawrence Han, scoring sophomore second baseman Max Jung-Goldberg and senior first baseman Alec Olmstead. Junior center fielder Ben Cleasby also singled, bringing Han home to make the score 4-0.\r\n\r\nPaly piled on five more runs in the third inning, building up a cushion that allowed the Vikings cruise through the rest of the game. \r\n\r\nDespite losing to Los Altos 1-0 earlier in the season, the Vikings felt prepared to take on the Eagles from the get-go, according to Hull.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we were all pretty ready, pretty pumped up about this game, playoffs are obviously a little more high-stakes,\u201d Hull said. \u201cI think we were just confident going in, and we got to them early, and kind of cruised on from there.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team\u2019s win puts them in a good position for their overall ranking at Leagues. \r\n\r\n\u201cIf we win [Leagues], we have Finals next week, and then on to CCS,\u201d Plambeck said. \u201c[We] got them again on Thursday; you have to put them away with a sweep.\u201d\r\n\r\nHull said that the Vikings will be able to win the second game, and thus the series, if they continue their performance from yesterday.\r\n\r\n\u201cLooking ahead to Thursday, hopefully we\u2019ll do something that\u2019s pretty similar: go out, score runs early, and keep doing it,\u201d Hull said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will play game two against the Eagles at 4 p.m. on Thursday at home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School baseball team (20-4-1, 12-2) crushed the Los Altos Eagles (15-12-0, 8-6) 9-0 yesterday at home in the first round of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League playoffs.
