As part of a multi-day Republican Convention, Kasich is one of three candidates who partook in the event, as presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke earlier on Friday and Ted Cruz spoke on Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice interviewed delegates and guests after the dinner banquet to learn more about what important political ideas they support, and how they view the three Republican candidates.\r\n\r\n<em>Videos by Adrienne Kwok.<\/em>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Susan Vander Schaaf:<\/strong>\r\nSusan Vander Schaaf has been a San Joaquin County Republican Party chairman since 2014, and previously worked as a secretary for Escalon Republican Women Federated. Vander Schaaf says she likes Kasich, but supports Ted Cruz for president and had supported Marco Rubio until his campaign\u2019s suspension. While she supports Cruz because he is a very conservative candidate, Vander Schaaf believes candidate Donald Trump is negatively affecting the Republican party and is hoping for a brokered republican convention.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fcgzAISYBTE\r\n\r\n<strong>Peter Ohtaki:<\/strong>\r\nPeter Ohtaki is the former mayor and two-term city council member of Menlo Park, elected in 2010 and 2014. A current California State Assembly candidate, Ohtaki says he supports Kasich because he will most likely foster bipartisan support in the White House and views Trump and Cruz as dangerous politicians who can divide the Republican party. As a member of the Menlo Park city council, Ohtaki helped balance the city\u2019s budget and oversee the local fire department.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jog6fEE5P3Y\r\n\r\n<strong>Gordon Humphrey:<\/strong>\r\nGordon Humphrey is a former New Hampshire senator who confidently voiced his support of Kasich. Humphrey, who served as senator from 1979 until 1990, helped shape America\u2019s policies on the Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan as a member of a specialized task force. He later unsuccessfully ran for New Hampshire governor twice and was a supporter of Edward Snowden after Snowden leaked classified information.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3wf01OWuK6Q\r\n\r\n<strong>Vanila Singh:<\/strong>\r\nA current delegate to San Mateo County and a doctor at Stanford University, Singh does not entirely support Kasich as a potential president, though she says she respects him as a person. According to Singh, the most important issue of this election is creating job opportunities, and that the Republican candidates are more competent than Sanders or Clinton in combating this problem.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GEtPbw1vbJk\r\n\r\n<strong>Yesenia Ceja:<\/strong>\r\nYesenia Ceja is a caterer who believes Trump is dividing the U.S. As a woman of Hispanic descent, Ceja says some of Trump\u2019s comments regarding immigration are racist and polarize the nation.

We have diversified our economy. We are running surpluses.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Kasich, he was able to vastly improve Ohio\u2019s economy by cutting taxes, balancing the budget and using common sense. He says he plans to use similar methods to alleviate America\u2019s debt and increase prosperity.\r\n\r\nKasich also addressed his opponents\u2019 policies, implying that Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are threatening to divide the nation. He also stated that the Democratic candidates\u2019 economic promises are unrealistic.\r\n\r\n\"Here's what I tell young people: you can have all the free\u00a0you want but at the end of the day with the nation $30 trillion in debt, you might go to a free college but you won't be able to get a job,\" Kasich said.\r\n\r\nKasich\u2019s political viewpoints were woven into several anecdotes describing his early life growing up in a working class household in a Pittsburgh suburb and his encounters with prominent figures such as President Nixon and the president of his alma mater as a youth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever remember having met a Republican [in my hometown],\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI am a blue-collar son of a Democratic mailman. And thank goodness, because that has allowed me to be able to understand and relate to people at every level.\u201d\r\n\r\nCalifornia Assembly Republican leader Chad Mayes and California State Senator Jean Fuller were among several politicians who attended\u00a0the dinner to endorse Kasich.\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout question, John Kasich is the best candidate to have at the top of the Republican ballot,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cHe can launch the conservative reform efforts needed to restore our nation. He can unite the party and win the White House. He is prepared to be commander in chief on day one and he has the track record to prove it.\u201d\r\n\r\nFormer U.S. Senator Gordon Humphrey also attended the banquet to show his support for Kasich.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like the fact that he is superbly qualified by virtue of experience and success as governor of Ohio.\u201d Humphrey said. \u201cHe has a noble soul and a golden heart and is an extraordinary human being. I think he is well qualified for the office in terms of experience and also in terms of temperament. He is respectful towards others, unlike some of the other candidates who are most unpresidential.\u201d\r\n\r\nKasich is currently in third place in the Republican presidential primary with 153 delegates. California will hold its Democratic\u00a0and Republican primaries on June 7.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/w7WHBbX1Hro\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<em>Photos by Adrienne Kwok.<\/em>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1cd_fLa8sPVWPHuXZJ7H6PFKd-AXQW_f6PRMUtl0yZkM\/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"600\" height=\"429\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<div class=\"conversation\">","excerpt":"Republican presidential candidate John Kasich took the stage to discuss the election and several key policies Friday night at the California Republican Convention in Burlingame.","date":"2016-05-01 13:22:25","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/IMG_76261.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","budget","burlingame","California","chad","convention","election","fuller","gordon","humphrey","jean","john","kasich","mayes","ohio","President","Republican","senator","Trump"]},{"id":119717,"title":"Sports Boosters to host auction tonight","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/30\/sports-boosters-to-host-auction-tonight\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_119718\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"475\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/IMG_4691.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-119718\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/IMG_4691.jpeg\" alt=\"IMG_4691\" width=\"475\" height=\"356\" \/><\/a> One of the items that will be available for bid tonight at the Palo Alto High School Sports Booster's auction is this painting of Hunter Pence from the Giant's.

While the protest generally remained peaceful, several brawls broke out between pro-Trump and anti-Trump attendees, and metal barriers surrounding the hotel were removed by protesters hoping to interrupt Trump\u2019s speech inside the hotel.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dozens\u00a0of police officers were dispatched to the scene after crowds attempted multiple times to enter the building, first through the front entrance and side doors and later by crossing an overpass linked to the car garage.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, protesters\u00a0carried signs with angry messages including \u201cMr. Hate leave my state,\u201d \u201cTrump is a rapist and conman\u201d and \u201cDump Trump.\u201d Others played\u00a0musical instruments or form barriers by linking arms.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Veria, one of hundreds of protesters, says she attended the demonstration to show her children the importance of being civically involved.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s so easy right now to sit back behind your phone screen or to be on social media being upset about things, but to actually take action is important,\u201d Veria said. \u00a0\u201cWe want to lead by example. We feel very strongly that these are not the values we want our children to grow up on and that they [Trump\u2019s values] are dangerous for the type of world we trying to build together.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other protesters cited Trump\u2019s alleged sexism or racism as reasons for protesting.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI hate Trump,\u201d said Sheila, who declined to disclose her last name. \u201cI hate that he\u2019s fascist. I hate that he hates women. I am Muslim, he says all Muslims are terrorists. Do I look like a terrorist?\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many protesters were eager to express their anger. Attendees carried Trump pi<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00f1atas and threw eggs at Trump cardboard cutouts, while others threw eggs at the hotel windows and shouted expletives at police officers for committing \u201cpolice brutality\u201d after several protesters were shoved and arrested by officers for attempting to enter the building. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of Trump's\u00a0supporters bore signs condemning the protesters, resulting in some hostile confrontations.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palo Alto High School junior Andy Chang attended part of the protest and says that Trump remains popular because he can connect with conservative voters\u2019 deeper fears.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI agree with many Republican values, however, I do not support any Republican candidates. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are just disgusting human beings,\u201d Chang said. \u201cThe media said that people vote for Trump is because he is \u2018tapping into the fears\u2019 of the people, a \u2018successful\u2019 businessman having confidence of not being politically correct, and so on. Most of their reasons are accurate. I remember the first time the media criticized Trump because he said many illegal immigrants are criminals, drug dealers and rapists, and the US should build a wall for them. This speech is indeed very extreme. But the general idea of strictly protecting the U.S. border is not extreme.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The protest largely dispersed by 2:30 p.m., when the shrinking crowds were told to leave by police because of unruly behavior. However, protesters say their ideas were loud and clear, as they hope to send a message that they will not tolerate hate in California.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<em>Photos by Aidan Maese-Czeropski.<\/em>\r\n<div id=\"cp_widget_200fe1a5-9848-416d-b12d-7346d9195816\">\r\n\r\n...\r\n<div id=\"cp_widget_aaef29d4-589b-4c16-b143-6380aa755a6a\">\r\n\r\n...<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\/\/ <![CDATA[\r\nvar cpo = []; cpo[\"_object\"] =\"cp_widget_aaef29d4-589b-4c16-b143-6380aa755a6a\"; cpo[\"_fid\"] = \"AcNAxf9oWZUK\"; var _cpmp = _cpmp || []; _cpmp.push(cpo); (function() { var cp = document.createElement(\"script\"); cp.type = \"text\/javascript\"; cp.async = true; cp.src = \"\/\/www.cincopa.com\/media-platform\/runtime\/libasync.js\"; var c = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; c.parentNode.insertBefore(cp, c); })();\r\n\/\/ ]]><\/script><noscript>Powered by Cincopa <a href='http:\/\/www.cincopa.com\/video-hosting'>Video Hosting Platform<\/a> for Business solution.<\/noscript>\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Hundreds of protesters including several Palo Alto High School students chanted messages and waved political banners to demonstrate against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at the California Republican Convention yesterday in Burlingame.","date":"2016-04-30 12:09:27","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/IMG_7076.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","burlingame","donald","election","hyatt","presidentiale","protest","Republican","Trump"]},{"id":119645,"title":"Annual Team Math competition to be held Tuesday","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/29\/annual-team-math-competition-to-be-held-tuesday\/","content":"The Annual Team Math competition, run by Palo Alto High School\u2019s Math\u00a0Club, will be held this Tuesday from 3:15 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. in the math building.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students will compete in teams of three to solve math problems and are encouraged to find group members that are in a range of different math classes. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"We want teams to match up people from a diverse range of math classes in order to give everyone an opportunity to compete, so we designed a point system based on the highest math class a participant has taken,\" said junior Jerry Hong, co-president of the Math Club.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hong, groups must have between 8-10 points in order to compete, with the point distribution working as follows:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ATM_Pts.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119650\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ATM_Pts.png\" alt=\"ATM_Pts\" width=\"600\" height=\"700\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hong, the ATM competition features three rounds: an individual competition, a team round, and a \"guts\" round, where the teams solve problem sets and get graded in real time.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to senior Lilia Tang, co-president of the Paly Math Club, the club added new features to the competition this year.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[The math club] had a lot of fun writing the contest this year,\" Tang said. \"We even added a new round called 'guts,' where participants can see their results updated live, and part of it includes estimation questions where you get partial credit depending on how close you get to the answer.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participating students will get free pizza and receive extra credit from their math teachers.

The district has implemented numerous protocols aimed at responding to tragedy after previous suicide clusters\u00a0involving district students occurred in 2009-2015. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">District Supt. Max McGee sent a letter notifying parents of the incident\u00a0on Saturday, though at the time, details surrounding the death were unknown.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday morning, some teachers read aloud a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1_pSSub74GYZ6eT4Kql0Q3k0Oe0csPZ3F_0uklKRTG5s\/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">message from the administration<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to their first period classes, informing students that Sarah Longyear, a 2014 graduate of Gunn High School, had died by suicide. The message also directed students to various mental health\u00a0related\u00a0resources<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Additionally, Diorio sent teachers a link to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tXQB7Mu5_BM&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that provides guidelines for discussing mental wellbeing with adolescents.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Diorio, administrators were\u00a0unsure as to whether they wanted to prepare a standardized script for teachers to read off to students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe just thought, and given how connected our students are with Gunn, that we wanted to be on the same page as them,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIt\u2019s that balance \u2014 we don\u2019t want to ignore this, and act like it didn\u2019t happen, and at the same time, we have to be careful about how we message it.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the individual who died was an alumna rather than a current student, Diorio says district officials were more measured in their direct outreach to students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe wanted to see how yesterday would unfold, before checking in directly with kids,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe wanted to give them the opportunity to come to us on their own, if they need support. When it was our own student, or when it was a current Gunn student, we were much more specific in identifying kids we wanted to check in with. We took it more case by case, instead of doing a universal check-in.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diorio says that she hopes\u00a0the teachers who needed additional support talking to their classes could have received it. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think one thing maybe I would have done differently, if a teacher was in that situation, I would have seen if we could have partnered them with someone who could have been in the classroom and talked with the kids,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough time to put that plan together.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, Diorio\u00a0encourages students, parents and staff to be there for each other and be proactive in combating issues relating to mental health.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s keeping those conversations about mental health going, talking about it, noticing when people might be struggling,\u201d Diorio said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Santa Clara\u00a0County Public Health Department is scheduled to release on May 4 the preliminary findings of its <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/13\/county-to-begin-health-investigation\/\" target=\"_blank\">Epi-Aid project<\/a>, an investigation aimed at combating student suicides which began in February.\r\n\r\n<em>A list of school and community resources is available on the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paly.net\/crisis-resources\">Paly crisis resources page<\/a>.
