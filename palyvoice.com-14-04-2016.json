These two will be accompanied by ASB secretary junior Kevin Chen. The treasurer position remains unfilled, along with the junior vice president position. These positions will be filled in a <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.io\/v\/118740\">special election<\/a> this Thursday and Friday.\r\n\r\nNagar said she believes the ASB president is a very influential position within the student government, and that it is key for\u00a0the president to make sure everyone has their voice heard.\r\n\r\n\"The ASB president is someone who empowers everyone in ASB to be their best,\" Nagar said. \"I think it's very important that the ASB president makes the ASB class somewhere people can brainstorm, plan, and execute their ideas, as well as receive input from the student body.\"\r\n\r\nNagar's counterpart, Lathi, is excited for the opportunity to bridge the gap between different grades, and strengthen the bonds between ASB and club officers. Lathi is also looking to reach out to the incoming freshman and help ensure a smooth transition into high school.\r\n\r\n\"Being vice president means that I\u00a0will be responsible chiefly for the connection between ASB and club officers, though I would also like to promote stronger bonds between students of different grades,\" Lathi said. \"I also hope to reach incoming freshmen, and garner their interest in participating in clubs prior to the first Club Day.\"\r\n\r\nChen believes that he will be playing a smaller role in ASB, but hopes to contribute as much as possible to group discussions.\r\n\r\n\"I don't really have an agenda or plans, but I hope to listen to to the ideas and give my two cents into the discussion,\" Chen said. \"Since this is my first year having an ASB position I do not have any big goals.\"\r\n\r\nThe full list of newly elected ASB and class officers can be viewed below.\r\n\r\nASB President: Anmol Nagar\r\nASB Vice President: Maya Lathi\r\nASB Treasurer: (unfilled)\r\nASB Secretary: Kevin Chen\r\n\r\nSenior President: Noa Ben-Efraim\r\nSenior Vice President: Natalie Maloney\r\n\r\nJunior President: Jaiveer Sandhu\r\nJunior Vice President: (unfilled)\r\n\r\nSophomore President: Caroline Furrier\r\nSophomore Vice President: Shannon Zhao","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body has announced the winners of the 2016-2017 election for ASB and class officer positions.","date":"2016-04-13 18:27:57","author":"Noah Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12312469_481970981983406_483221451_n.jpg","categories":["ASB Election 2016","News"],"tags":["ASB","ben-efraim","Chen","election","Furrier","junior","Lathi","maloney","nagar","officer","President","sandhu","secretary","senior","sophomore","treasurer","vice president","winners","Zhao"]},{"id":118866,"title":"Admin investigates window vandalism","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/12\/admin-investigates-window-vandalism\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_118873\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"596\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/IMG_0574-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-118873 \" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/IMG_0574-2.jpg\" alt=\"window vandalism\" width=\"596\" height=\"447\" \/><\/a> A Palo Alto High School student observes the damage done to her science classroom before entering sixth\u00a0period yesterday. Room P9 was one of multiple classrooms targeted by a student who shot at windows with a BB gun over Spring Break, according to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson. Photo: Adrienne Kwok.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School administration is working to repair damage done to multiple buildings after discovering eight shattered windows last Tuesday, according to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson.\r\n\r\nBerkson said he received a call during Spring Break indicating an individual had used a BB gun to shoot at classrooms P6A, P9, P12 and 901, which include science portables and an administrative building. Paly is covering the broken windows with plywood while waiting for the out-of-stock replacements to arrive.\r\n\r\nThe administration is analyzing the extent of the damage before deciding on\u00a0a penalty, according to Berkson. The perpetrators, currently unidentified, could face legal consequences and pay upwards of $1000 in damage. Other repercussions may include suspension, a permanent addition to a student\u2019s record that could affect their college eligibility, says Berkson.\r\n\r\nThe administration may take further legal action, as a BB gun was brought on\u00a0campus. According to the Paly Student Handbook, weapons, including paint ball and squirt guns, are prohibited on campus and could result in PAUSD expulsion and\u00a0arrest per\u00a0the California State Educational Code.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving been a teenager at one time, I understand that kids may sometimes do things that are inappropriate,\u201d Berkson said. \u201cKids should really think about what they are doing before they do it, because the consequences could be a very big deal.\u201d\r\n\r\nOther than a decrease in natural lighting, science teacher Elizabeth Brimhall, whose classroom suffered a broken window, does not believe the vandalism is significantly affecting her teaching.\r\n\r\n\"It's shocking and I think the students were surprised [at the vandalism]\u201d Brimhall said. \u201cFor me, luckily it\u2019s not the only window we have so we have other ways to get light in the room. It [vandalism] has a minor effect except for the fact that it\u2019s a sad thing to have happened.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly is no new victim to vandalism. In February, a student <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/16\/admin-investigates-franco-mural-vandalism\/\" target=\"_blank\">spray painted<\/a> over one of two James Franco murals with red\u00a0words, \u201cHow do you vandalize garbage?\"\r\n\r\nStudents responded to the most recent vandalism by expressing their disapproval.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't think that's okay at all,\u201d junior Aman Mittal said. \u201cVandalizing the school you learn in is so disrespectful, and we're blessed to go to a beautiful-looking school like Paly.\u201d","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School administration is working to repair damages done to multiple buildings after discovering eight shattered windows on Tuesday.","date":"2016-04-12 11:32:37","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/IMG_0574-2.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["assistant","bb","Berkson","brimhall","elizabeth","franco","gun","james","Jerry","mural","plywood","principal","science","suspension","vandalism","window"]},{"id":118916,"title":"Paly Orchestra and Band concert at 7:00 p.m. on Thursday, April 14 in Haymarket Theater","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/12\/paly-orchestra-and-band-concert-at-700-p-m-on-thursday-april-14-in-haymarket-theater\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-04-12 11:32:36","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":118906,"title":"Paly cheer and dance team tryouts Monday, April 11 to Friday, April 15","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/12\/cheer-and-dance-tryouts-monday-april-11-to-friday-april-15\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-04-12 11:25:52","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":118892,"title":"Alternate schedule on Tuesday, April 19 due to sophomore testing","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/12\/alternate-schedule-on-tuesday-april-19th-due-to-sophomore-testing\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-04-12 11:17:37","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":118413,"title":"Ohlone teacher expected to enter plea Monday","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/11\/ohlone-teacher-expected-to-enter-plea-monday\/","content":"An Ohlone Elementary School teacher on unpaid compulsory leave\u00a0is expected to enter a plea 9 a.m. Monday, April 18 at the Palo Alto Courthouse after\u00a0postponing\u00a0his arraignment in a case involving charges of child sexual abuse.\r\n\r\nIn a\u00a0court presided over by Judge Kenneth P.
