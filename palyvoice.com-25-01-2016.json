Photo: Bryce Rockwell.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWhen students, faculty and friends gather in the Media Arts Center at Palo Alto High School on Saturday to mark the passing of science teacher Kenyon Scott, they will be celebrating a man whose passion for teaching impacted many community members' lives.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Scott passed away due to natural causes on the morning of Jan. 6, 2016, at his residence in Palo Alto. He was 60.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to students, colleagues, and family, Scott was an optimistic, energetic man who always maintained a passion for teaching students in a classroom environment filled with infectious laugher. He cared for his students in a uniquely powerful way by celebrating each person as an individual.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"He was a really nice teacher who respected his students and treated them with patience and respect,\" junior Spencer Wycoff said. \"He was always with a smile and trying to make people happy in his class.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Mr. Scott's well-known and loved mantras,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u201ctrust and respect,\u201d emphasized his philosophy of care between students and their teachers. On campus, he could be found actively participating in staff and school-wide events, annually drawing repeated chants of \u201cMr. Scott!\u201d at the Staff Dance during Spirit Week. When he saw his students outside of the classroom, he never failed to greet them by name and give them a smile.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"I didn\u2019t think of him as a teacher, but a really close friend,\" senior Dami Bolarinwa said. \"He was someone who I could talk to about problems.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Paly Voice sat down and spoke\u00a0with one of his two daughters, Emily Scott, a special education instructional aide at Paly, about her father's\u00a0life growing up. Born on June 24, 1955, in San Jose, Mr. Scott\u2019s dream job as a child was to be president of the United States. Rather than sleeping with a pillow, he spent most nights with Jojo,<span style=\"color: #007f00;\">\u00a0<\/span>his beloved stuffed animal monkey, the younger Scott said, adding that she recalled that her father's family made an appearance on one of the early episodes of Family Feud; the Scott family was eliminated after his brother Jon Scott was unable to correctly identify a Jewish holiday.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Scott could be found during his childhood summers working at Bay Meadows, a horse racing track in San Mateo that closed in 2008. He graduated from Pioneer High School in San Jose before attending the University of California at Berkeley, where he majored in Earth Sciences. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those that were close to him, especially his high school students, know just how attached he was to exploring the outdoors and spreading awareness about environmental issues. He rode his bike to Paly every morning alongside hundreds of students, even during the rainy season when many students would catch a ride with their parents during a downpour. In class, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to put lessons on hold to discuss and monitor current environmental events going on at a local or even international level. He valued the importance of not just teaching his students about the environment, but encouraging them to apply classroom lessons to the real world. Many of his extra credit assignments involved researching newsworthy environmental topics or going to the Palo Alto Baylands to explore natural habitats.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"When we would go on trips he would always stop and look at rocks,\" Emily Scott recounted. \"He was very into rocks and fossils.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His first job teaching was at Charles Armstrong School in Belmont, a school for children with special needs, according to his daughter. It was during this time when he met his wife, Katherine, to whom he was married to for approximately 18 years until their divorce. Outside of teaching, he loved doing crossword puzzles, reading newspapers, discovering new music and playing games with his two daughters.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Paly, he taught a variety of subjects including physics, chemistry, and most notably, Advanced Placement Environmental Science, popularly for over 18 years, beginning in 1985. According to his daughter, he left Paly in 1991 to work for Apple in the technology industry before returning to the classroom in 2003. He supervised numerous clubs over the course of his time at Paly, and was the Paly Environmental Club adviser at the time of his passing. He also served as Paly\u2019s student activities director in the late 1980s.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss for our community and our school,\u201d Paly principal Kim Diorio said. \u201cHe was a great man, great teacher. I\u2019m personally going to miss him tremendously.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to his meaningful lessons in science, Mr. Scott will be widely remembered for his classroom traditions. On Friday afternoons, he would lead his classes in a \u201cTGIF\u201d chant to celebrate the beginning of the weekend. His most beloved teaching tradition is simply known as \u201cThe Clap.\u201d To begin class, he would stand up in the front of the room and start clapping in a rhythm that his students would soon replicate in unison. After a few rounds of clapping, he would welcome his class and begin doing what he did best, helping high school students become not just smarter thinkers, but better people.<\/span>\r\n\r\nHe is survived by his parents, Joan and Jerry Scott; sister Laurie Burmeister; brothers Joe and Jon Scott; daughters Emily and Elizabeth Scott; and his partner, Sara Tanous.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students and colleagues say it will be a long time before we come across another teacher who leads the clap, spreads environmental optimism and inspires students the way Mr.\u00a0Scott did.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"People loved him, and I don't think he will be forgotten,\" junior Emily Read said. \"[Principal] Kim Diorio came to visit our class, and she was in tears. She was crying so hard, and I could see the connection that he had made being here for so long. He impacted so many people.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1182669811\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Saturday\u2019s<\/span><\/span> celebration of life event for Mr. Scott, originally scheduled for the Quad but moved to the MAC out of concern for the weather, will begin at <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1182669812\"><span class=\"aQJ\">2 p.m.<\/span><\/span>\u00a0Attendees are encouraged to wear blue and gold clothing, the colors of his alma mater, UC Berkeley.<\/span>","excerpt":"Recently, Palo Alto High School lost one of its most beloved teachers, Kenyon Scott.

It\u2019s important because if flooding coincides with a Baylands supertide, flooding could be worse.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, families can gather supplies, according to Lee. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s better to have a plan and not need it,\u201d Lee said. \u201cPeople can prepare if they live in a flood zone by stocking on emergency supplies like flashlights, candles, bottled water, canned food for people and pets, other supplies like a wrench in case they need to turn off their gas and knowing how to turn it off.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other preparations include purchasing plastic tarps and sandbags, putting things high up off the ground, and arranging for pet care, according to Lee.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who are interested in either providing or seeking shelter can contact Lee at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:liz@funghi.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">liz@funghi.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"In light of the increase of rain that El Ni\u00f1o brings, a Palo Alto High School parent is aiming to provide shelter for Paly families at risk of flooding.","date":"2016-01-21 18:14:35","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/2.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["El nino","evacuation","flood","high school","palo alto","paly"]},{"id":114557,"title":"Teachers defeat students at Winter Rally","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/21\/teachers-defeat-students-at-winter-rally\/","content":"The teachers defeated the senior class at the first student vs. staff soccer game during the Winter Rally last week.

Leong led the Vikings early on, scoring seven\u00a0out of her 13 total points in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings\u00a0extended their lead in the second half, scoring 18 in the third quarter and 20 in the fourth.\r\n\r\nTransitioning and rebounding were major keys to routing Los Altos, according to junior guard Lauren Koyama, who scored 10 points\u00a0in the game.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe usually don\u2019t offensively transition or rebound that well, so improving on those factors were significant to the win,\u201d Koyama said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings began to edge away in the second quarter as shots started to go in, according to Leong.\r\n\r\n\u201cW<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e hadn't\u00a0been playing great lately and we clicked this game<\/span>,\u201d Leong said. \"My threes were going in and we were doing well.\"\r\n\r\nSenior forward Courtney Lovely also racked up eight points in the second quarter, putting Paly up 13 points by halftime.\r\n\r\nThe team played well as a unit, according to senior center Alexis Harris, who returned to the lineup from a leg injury.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it was a good win today,\u201d Harris said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings play next against Wilcox High School at 7 p.m. on Tuesday at Gunn.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 basketball team (10-6, 3-2) trounced over Los Altos High School (10-5, 1-2) with a 69-31 domination on Friday at Gunn High School. \r\n","date":"2016-01-21 10:31:31","author":"Sam Lee","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Untitled-1.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["alexis harris","ball","basketball","carly leong","courtney lovely","girls","hustle","lauren koyama","los altos","maddy atwater","paly","rebound","scott peters","sports","team","transition","vikings","win"]},{"id":114598,"title":"Video: Staff defeats students in Winter Rally soccer game","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/20\/video-staff-defeats-students-in-winter-rally-soccer-game\/","content":"With ongoing gym construction\u00a0at Palo Alto High School,\u00a0the 2016 Winter Rally featured a staff-vs.-student soccer game.
