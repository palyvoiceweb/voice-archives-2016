According to head coach Don Briggs, this allowed him to change the lineup later in the game, when Paly was leading 3-0.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were able to possess the ball when we needed to,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cTen minutes into the second half, we started putting people in different positions. Doing that is actually good for them because it gives them the chance to work on different things.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings took advantage of their offensive opportunities much better than in previous matches, with goals by senior midfielder Cole Tierney, senior defender Cam Huard, senior forward Max Hallberg, senior midfielder Dami Bolarinwa and senior forward Ariya Momeny.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe got five goals and we capitalized on most of our opportunities, which is an improvement from our other games,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cI definitely have more confidence now and I think a lot of people do because there was a wealth of goals. That\u2019s always good to build confidence and have confidence in other people too.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Mountain View head coach Jim Mcguirk, the Spartans struggled to adjust their defensive strategy against Paly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDefensively, we\u2019ve played pretty good all year, but we didn\u2019t play as good today,\u201d Mcguirk said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t adjust to how fast they were. There were things we could\u2019ve done, like changed positioning to be in the right spots. We were in the spots that we\u2019re in against other teams, but we didn\u2019t adjust to their speed and get into different positions where we could handle their speed better.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings worked together more effectively in this game than they had in previous weeks, according to Bolarinwa.\r\n\r\n\"We moved the ball, got open, found the time to pass and hold the ball,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cIt was really good to see how our team is finally clicking together.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly will play Fremont High School (2-4-3, 1-1-1) at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday at Fremont.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' soccer team (8-0-1, 4-0) dominated the Mountain View High School Spartans (5-2-4, 0-1-1) on Friday at the Paly soccer field with a score of 5-0.","date":"2016-01-18 22:38:20","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/IMG_7965.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap"],"tags":["ariya momeny","boys soccer","cam huard","cole tierney","dami bolarinwa","don briggs","jim mcguirk","max hallberg","mountain view","palo alto high school","roberto sotelo","Soccer","spartans","vikings"]},{"id":114478,"title":"Advisory this week is for all sophomores and select freshmen (A-K)","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/17\/advisory-this-week-is-for-all-sophomores-and-select-freshmen-a-k\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-17 23:33:14","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":114273,"title":"Palo Alto teen center to celebrate grand opening","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/16\/palo-alto-teen-center-to-celebrate-grand-opening\/","content":"The Mitchell Park Community Center will host food, games\u00a0and a DJ in honor of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Mitchell-Park-Teen-Center\/475685722572832\">Fridays at the Drop's grand opening<\/a> next Friday.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Drop,\u201d a teen center specially designed for high school students in Palo Alto, is a drop-in space for those looking to relax, hang out with friends or play sports and video games, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityofpaloalto.org\/gov\/depts\/csd\/recreation\/teens\/drop.asp\">City of Palo Alto website<\/a>.

According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skypossepaloalto.org\">Sky Posse\u2019s website<\/a>, changes by the Federal Aviation Administration have led to increased air traffic over Palo Alto neighborhoods, and many residents claim this lowers the city's standard of living and causes unneeded distractions.\r\n\r\nThe\u00a0meeting included information regarding Sky Posse\u2019s website, methods for reporting airplanes as well as general information and an update from the City of Palo Alto. According to the update from senior management analyst Kashayar \"Cash\" Alaee, the city plans on implementing a study on airplane noise and cooperating with locals in Palo Alto.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_114305\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"375\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/12513623_10203895767433452_8899129206085221806_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-114305\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/12513623_10203895767433452_8899129206085221806_o.jpg\" alt=\"12513623_10203895767433452_8899129206085221806_o\" width=\"375\" height=\"281\" \/><\/a> Sky Posse leaders\u00a0Rachel Kellerman and Jennifer Landesmann presented a series of statistics and solutions at the organization's meeting Wednesday\u00a0night. \"Working with the FAA is the only way to stop the plane noise,\" Landesmann said.

Although traffic at nearby airports in San Jose and San Francisco is growing, this newfound noise mainly results from the new Next Generation Air Transportation System, which shortens flight distances and times and saves fuel while simultaneously increasing flights over urban areas.\r\n\r\nSince NextGen\u2019s implementation, complaints against airplane noise from Palo Altans has mushroomed. Wednesday\u00a0night\u2019s meeting represented the culmination of months of research and lobbying for reduced sound, according to Landesmann.\r\n\r\nWhile Sky Posse mainly aims to address noise pollution, the organization also points out potential health risks associated with numerous low-flying aircrafts. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/news.nationalgeographic.com\/news\/2010\/10\/101005-planes-pollution-deaths-science-environment\/\">National Geographic<\/a>, plane emissions cause 10,000 deaths in the world each year. Landesmann says that the benefits of shifted flight routes outweighs the loss of jet fuel that could be saved by simply flying straight over the Bay Area.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_114304\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"336\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/12473653_10203895766273423_6465419346657067747_o1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-114304\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/12473653_10203895766273423_6465419346657067747_o1.jpg\" alt=\"12473653_10203895766273423_6465419346657067747_o\" width=\"336\" height=\"367\" \/><\/a> Sky Posse co-leader Rachel Kellerman poses with a board mapping airplane noise complaints in the Peninsula. \"Nothing will change ...

The red card, given to junior center defender Neil Verwillow, also resulted in a free kick play right outside of the goal box. The free kick resulted in Gunn\u2019s only goal, allowing them to get back into the game, down by one goal with a score of 2-1 with 25 minutes left in the second half.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe got that red card and then they scored a goal,\u201d head coach Don Briggs said. \u201cIt felt like \u2018Oh my gosh, we\u2019re in a dog fight now, 2-1.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings were able to come into the game with a lot of energy, according to junior forward Michel Ange Siaba.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe came on the field very pumped because, you know, this is Gunn,\u201d Siaba said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate game. The energy was really high up, which is probably our greatest strength right now: coming onto the field with energy and challenging the opponent.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter a roughly even first half, the Vikings led 1-0 on a goal scored by senior midfielder Dami Bolarinwa, finished off of a slowed breakaway by senior forward Alessandro Reale. Despite leading in score, both teams struggled with keeping possession during the first half.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat first half was a little sketchy,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the kids were a little bit nervous, but it seemed like they were holding onto the ball and waiting for the perfect pass, and then they\u2019d make a bad pass. We make three or four or five good passes and then we make one bad pass and give it up, and we\u2019re back on our heels again.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Gunn head coach Ken Luis, facing Paly was a challenge, but the Titans performed well.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of the players were really up for the Palo Alto rivalry,\u201d Luis said. \u201cThis is always a big game.

Max McGee.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the fence] runs along the whole sides of the tracks,\u201d McGee said. \u201cSome of the fencing had been up before, and it was already secure, but they took out vegetation and this other fence that was frankly easy to climb.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to McGee, the improvement to fencing along the tracks is an effort to address the means by which multiple students have died by suicide in recent years. The fence should serve as a physical deterrent to gaining access to the tracks, but also as a symbol of the value that the community holds in its members lives, McGee said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a constant reminder of how important the city, the schools, the parents, the students consider each other's lives,\u201d McGee said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very positive reminder that you [the students] matter so deeply to us. If someone has this impulse to run onto the train tracks or to hop the fence, it will make it much more difficult. Sometimes, that little bit of delay is enough to make someone think \u2018Well, at least I'm going to call someone first.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly parent Lauren Barley was the first to thoroughly advocate for means restriction in Palo Alto, the limiting of access to the way by which the most well-known suicides have been committed in this community, following the first student suicide of the 2014-15 cluster of suicides within the Palo Alto community, according to McGee.\r\n\r\nBarley, who knows the family of the girl from Woodside that died by suicide in 2014, was moved by how the community came together in the wake of Byron's death, the Paly sophomore who committed suicide in March, 2015.\r\n\r\n\"I attended the two parent events that Paly held and was struck by how these deaths had such an extended and deep impact on administrators and students, even those who did not know Byron directly,\" Barley said.\r\n\r\nBarley researched \"means restriction,\" which, in the context of Palo Alto, specifically focused on railroad access. She presented her findings to Caltrain along with McGee and city officials.\r\n\r\n\"I was driven by the belief that reducing access to Caltrain in Palo Alto would reduce and prevent deaths by suicide,\" Barley said.\r\n\r\nAccording to McGee, the City of Palo Alto officials also assumed a great role in pursuing the effort to improve fencing and sensor technology along the Caltrain railroad by participating in meetings and advocating for the project.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [city officials] really took the lead in these meetings and persisted with Caltrain,\u201d McGee said. \u201cIt [the project] was funded by Caltrain and the city. They\u2019re also looking at putting in sensors to sense if someone does get over or around the fence at a crossing.\"\r\n\r\nRestricting the means by which someone may harm themselves serves as way to force them to slow down and does not allow them to act as impulsively as they might otherwise, according to McGee.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you have to climb, or get a ladder, or walk across one crossing or the other, that two to three minutes can make someone reconsider and think, \u2018What am I doing?\u2019\u201d McGee said.","excerpt":"Caltrain, the commuter rail that runs from San Francisco to San Jose, is undertaking a project in collaboration with the city of Palo Alto to further restrict access to the train tracks by installing new fencing along both sides of the rail in Palo Alto.","date":"2016-01-14 15:52:55","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/DSC_0010.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["caltrain","fence","McGee","means prevention","palo alto","palo alto high school","railroad","suicide","Suicide prevention","superintendent","tracks"]},{"id":114287,"title":"Celebration of Life for Kenyon Scott will be at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 23 on the Quad","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/14\/celebration-of-life-for-kenyon-scott-will-be-at-2-p-m-on-saturday-jan-23-on-the-quad\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-14 15:12:22","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":114259,"title":"Prom 2016 will be held at the Design Galleria in San Francisco","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/14\/prom-2016-will-be-held-at-the-design-galleria-in-san-francisco\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-01-14 11:02:43","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]}]
