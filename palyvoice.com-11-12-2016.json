The first goal came off a direct free kick by junior forward\u00a0Ally Scheve, quickly followed by a second goal from sophomore forward Leela Srinivasan. Paly kept the ball on El Camino\u2019s side of the field for the majority of the first half, scoring three more goals before the initial 45 minutes came to a close.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite entering the second half with a score of 5-0, the Vikings did not slow down.

Gambino incorporates a groovy motif throughout the album that ties individual songs together to create a seamless collective work.\r\n\r\nHere are in-depth examinations of the tracks that stand\u00a0out from the rest of the album.\r\n\r\n<strong>Me and Your Mama<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first single released from the album, \"Me and Your Mama\" s<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tarts slowly, opening like a lullaby with chime-like\u00a0and dreamy synths.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A choir loop enters<\/span>\u00a0as more high-pitched synths join in the background. The original synth ostinato continues throughout.\r\n\r\nThe percussion, provided by hi-hats and snaps, keep a slow and melodic R&amp;B rhythm. The choir\u2019s vocalization is airy and disjointed, repeating an unintelligible melody.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first two minutes, this pattern is repeated, setting a mood that\u00a0feels relaxed and redundant.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the second minute comes to a close, a fast, repeating beat enters and gradually grows in volume.\u00a0At 2:02, a blues-tinged guitar chord blasts out,\u00a0smothering the droning choir and starting a new, funkier section of the song.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suddenly, Gambino's wailing voice<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0enters the vocal stage, screaming an anguished whine alongside the bold and buzzy cadence of the guitar. Soon after this begins, a<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n ensemble of soulful voices transform the song into a gospel rock anthem.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gambino\u2019s grizzly and distorted voice howls heartbroken and bluesy lyrics about the perils of love as an acoustic guitar and synths join in, the choir harmonizing in the background.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The song slows down to a mellow and soft ballad, complete with the tender chords from an organ as the low warbles of a synth fade into silence.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe dichotomous sounds form an enjoyable\u00a0song that exhibits how much Gambino has changed from his first studio album, \"Camp.\"<em>\u00a0<\/em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Redbone<\/strong>\r\n\r\nRedbone, the second single to be released from this album, is a masterfully done reconstruction of funk to accentuate an enhanced, deeper and more sober single.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The melody strolls at an andante tempo with synths chattering while kits roll at a walking pace. Gambino's f<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alsetto voice contrasts and complements the deep bass and soulful feeling of the melody. His stretched out\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">screeches evoke emotion, especially adding a forlorn quality to the sound.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chorus transforms the low synths and funky melody into a more orchestral climax, where Gambino's voice and the harmony of the choir seem to exchange dialogue and emotion. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The song utilizes pop instrument with a slower, moderate tempo to create a sort of futuristic feeling that is both uplifting and melancholy.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redbone's beautiful melody paints a picture of a casual, groovy stroll down a boulevard on a late, starry night.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It shows Gambino's\u00a0ability to create slow-paced songs with vocals that take a backseat, letting the complex layers of innovative instruments guide the listener. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Boogieman<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attention to detail in this track is evident. The chorus of voices starts high,\u00a0dominating other instruments at the beginning of the song.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gradually, the lower frequency becomes louder as the voices get lower until the piece reaches a tenor that matches and gets drowned out by the underlying drum. This technique helps create a streamlined transition from vocals to instrumental. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boogieman was one of the songs that stood out as an h<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">omage to boogie rock and the high energy dance music from the 1970's funk scene. The piece is an innovative fusion of old-school dance music with a synth-garnished modern flare, making it the mo<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">st fast-paced and energetic song on the album.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Baby Boy<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This song is an ode to Gambino's recently born son. \"Baby Boy\" sounds like a lullaby, confessing the artist's desires and fears of parenthood. The vocals feel like a parent lulling their child to sleep, caressing and mellow, yet optimistic, giving the listener serenity and peace in its' sound.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">T<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he use of the glockenspiel is appropriate for a sort of simple, melodic feeling. Similarly, \u00a0Gambino uses the clavinet\u00a0to mimic a crying baby with the \"wah wah\"\u00a0sound of the\u00a0chords\u00a0serving as the bass line for the song. However, the use of guitar does not match the feeling of a lullaby at times.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ending simple instrumental solo immerses the listener in a calming, sleepy feeling.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Two songs to Avoid<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Zombies<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Zombies\" gives off a thriller vibe and is reminiscent of a 1990's pop song. There is some interesting use of the rain stick but the instrumental tends not to match the feeling of lyrics, which are unnecessarily creepy and\u00a0uninspired. Overall, the song feels far from innovative or experimental.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Terrified<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Terrfied\" is well-intentioned but the lackluster and unflattering pitchiness in the chorus jars the listener. However, the end shines with minimal melody and an impressive soul back and forth between Gambino and his predominantly female guest choir.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nAll in all this album is refreshing and we would highly recommend it to any reader.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">List of Songs: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<\/span>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Me and Your Mama \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6:19<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Have Some Love \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3:44<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Boogieman \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3:36<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Zombies \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04:41<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Riot \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02:05<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Redbone \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5:26<\/li>\r\n\t<li>California \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2:45<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Terrified \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4:15<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Baby Boy \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a06:22<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The Night Me and Your Mama Met \u00a0 3:34<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Stand Tall \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a06:10<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nAlbum Length: 48:57\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A4xnq1L6P551Qcb9gBXNMK7\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"Donald Glover, better known by his stage name, Childish Gambino, has become known for his versatility in talent between acting and producing music.

She dribbled deftly past multiple Gunn High School defenders, using her foot skills to advance towards the goal. Preising looked up just in time to see freshman Chloe Japic making a cut and passed a leading ball to her. Japic took a few small touches and wound up a shot at the goal. Needless to say, she took care of the rest.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Japic\u2019s goal asserted the Palo Alto High School (4-0, 0-0) \u00a0girls\u2019 soccer team\u2019s dominance in the first half, giving the Vikings a 1-0 lead against the Titans (1-2-1, 0-0) at the Gunn field last Thursday night. Preising later scored a goal off a header from a corner kick by junior Emily Tomz in the second half, extending Paly\u2019s lead to 2-0. Gunn made a late goal, but it was not enough to make a comeback, and the game ended with a score of 2-1.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Preising, playing against Gunn was an exciting matchup, despite the game being part of the preseason schedule.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPlaying Gunn is always fun and it's always been a good experience,\u201d Preising said. \u201cI love playing them [Titans], and I am definitely glad to take part in this rivalry.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly girls' soccer coach Jon Seedman expressed his opinion on the competition between Paly and Gunn.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGunn always gives us their best shot,\u201d Seedman said. \u201cI think if Gunn goes through its season and loses every game but beats Paly, that is a successful season for them. You can definitely see it in their [Gunn players\u2019] eyes and with the way they played. They were extremely pumped up. If you looked at the faces of the winning team and losing team and didn\u2019t know who won, you would've thought the opposite way. They were so happy that they had given us a battle. It's not that much of a rivalry for us as much as it is for them.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preising said while playing the game, she observed what the team\u00a0needs to work on for the future.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI thought we would score more goals because we kept possession in their attacking third quite often and we took a lot of shots,\u201d Preising said. \u201cThe team dynamic isn\u2019t as great as it needs to be but I think the team looks forward to improving that. We definitely need to work on shooting. We had multiple opportunities for easy shots but we chose to pass instead. We don\u2019t have many players who like to shoot so that is something we need to work on as a team.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Preising believes that the struggles will sort itself out through practice and as the season develops.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seedman also commented that the team can work to build its chemistry with the younger players on the team.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey are great socially but when we\u2019re playing, we\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d Seedman said. \u201cChloe [Japic] really played well and scored our first goal. She made a lot of other good plays but she needs to figure out the way we play as a team, but that will come.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team (4-0, 0-0) beat the Gunn High School Titans (0-2-1, 0-0) last Thursday night at Gunn by a score of 2-1.","date":"2016-12-08 09:31:55","author":"Sam Lee","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/emily-tomz-2.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["chloe japic","emily tomz","freshman","gunn","Jon Seedman","paly","preseason","recap","Tess Preising","titans","vikings","win"]}]
