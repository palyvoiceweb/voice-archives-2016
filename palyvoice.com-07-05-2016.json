The building has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meyersound.com\/product\/constellation\/\">Constellation sound system<\/a>, which is a digitally acoustic environment that can change depending on the performer and what type of sound they want, according to Najar.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt changes the audience's perspective of the sound,\u201d Najar said. \u201cThe system doesn't feel inauthentic and the bottom line is that it creates delay and strength without them even knowing it.

Photo: Eli Zucker[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School Robotics team looks to continue this year's success after scoring in the top 30 in its division at last weekend\u2019s FIRST Robotics Competition World Championships in St. Louis.\r\n\r\nThe team, also known as Team 8, ranked 27 out of 75 teams in their division. According to sophomore team member Bert Davies, 600 teams around the world, including nations such as Canada and Israel, participated in the competition.\r\n\r\nDuring the competition, teams are randomly matched together and work with each other to score the most points in a certain amount of time, according to Davies. Teams can score points by crossing barriers with their robots or shooting balls into a tower. Robots are controlled remotely by drivers. The alliance that wins the match gets points added to its cumulative score. The top three teams from each of the eight divisions advance to the playoffs.\r\n\r\nTeam 8 qualified to the competition through a series of wild cards during the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/18\/robotics-team-to-compete-at-world-championship\/\">Central Valley Regional<\/a>, according to Davies. At Regionals, the top 10 teams were selected to go compete at Worlds. However, some of the top 10 teams were already guaranteed a spot at Worlds, leaving empty spots up for grabs. Therefore, even though Paly was not in the top 10, Team 8 filled the empty spots, thereby giving them a place to compete at Worlds.\r\n\r\nAt Worlds, although Team 8 did not end up placing in the finals, team members say that they are still very grateful for the experience.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were able to watch exciting matches of all of the world-class teams,\u201d sophomore scouting and strategy captain Shota Yamamoto said. \u201cThe experience was great because we got to talk to teams from all over the world and learn about how their teams function in terms of team structure, their design phase and many other things.\u201d\r\n\r\nTeam members were also able to learn more about robotics and different design tips and tricks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were a ton of really cool workshops discussing how to improve your robot,\u201d Davies said.\r\n\r\nLooking towards next year, the team is looking to make changes to improve the team's efficiency.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want to have a stronger team structure and stay a bit more organized,\u201d Yamamoto said. \u201cAnother thing we are aiming for is more diversity on the team, with a better ratio of guys to girls.\u201d\r\n\r\nRobotics students\u00a0have started a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyrobotics.com\/summercamp\">summer outreach program<\/a> for middle school students from around the Bay Area to attend, according to Yamamoto. The camp will teach different skills for robotics, including data analysis and coding. They have also separately created a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firstinspires.org\/robotics\/fll\">FIRST Lego League<\/a> team for middle school students to build and compete with Lego robots.\r\n\r\nAccording to team members, robotics provides a great place for students to learn about robotics and build a community.\r\n\r\n\u201cI love robotics because the people on the team are really nice to each other,\u201d Yamamoto said. \u201cEveryone on the team is really close with each other too. Another thing is that it is not just about building a robot. At competition ... each team has to compete with two other random teams [as allies]. In order to succeed in these matches, your alliance has to communicate with each other ... I love robotics because I have gained and learned so much about technical skills, leadership skills and communication skills.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith members hoping to advance to Worlds again next year, they have already started preparing and tinkering with their current robot.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the next step, I want to build a whole new robot for practice, using the information and tips we gained at Worlds,\u201d Davies said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Robotics team looks to continue this year's success after scoring in the top 30 in its division at last weekend\u2019s FIRST Robotics Competition World Championships in St. Louis.","date":"2016-05-05 17:47:54","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Chris-Linn-image-95.jpeg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Bert Davies","First Lego League","FIRST Robotics World Championships","paly robotics","Shota Yamamoto","team 8","Worlds"]},{"id":119985,"title":"One Acts to showcase student creativity","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/05\/one-acts-to-showcase-student-creativity\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_120100\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"323\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/13169814_1123054514425884_1449289915_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-120100\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/13169814_1123054514425884_1449289915_o.jpg\" alt=\"13169814_1123054514425884_1449289915_o\" width=\"323\" height=\"431\" \/><\/a> Sophomore Peter King (left)\u00a0and junior Declan Flanders\u00a0(right) act as cows for the one act \"Cow Play,\" directed by senior Ophir Sneh. \"Cow Play\" is the only student-written play this year.\u00a0Photo by Takaaki Sagawa.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School theater department will showcase\u00a0a realm\u00a0of\u00a0student-run\u00a0plays in\u00a0its annual One Acts production from Thursday to\u00a0Saturday in the Haymarket Theatre.\r\n\r\nThe production will consist of seven one-act plays, all of which feature student producers, directors and actors. According to producer and senior Matt O'Reilly, student directors are given autonomy, which adds\u00a0personal flavor\u00a0to each\u00a0play.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span>I was interested in having each director do what felt right to them,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d\u00a0<\/span>O'Reilly said. \u201cWhen you come and get to see your friends on stage or your friends who are directing them [the plays], you will really get a feel for that individual and how that individual wanted his actors to be portrayed on stage.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior\u00a0Jason Pollack, who will be directing \u201cDo Engineers Dream of Androids?\u201d as a third-year One Acts director,\u00a0has\u00a0utilized the opportunity to experiment by implementing\u00a0new developments in\u00a0his\u00a0play.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere's lots of things we wouldn't usually be able to do in a theater production, but Matt [O'Reilly] has given us the ability to spread out and come up with our own ideas, so we have much more creative freedom,\u201d Pollack said.\r\n\r\nOne Acts will include one\u00a0student-written play\u00a0\u201cCow Play\u201d by senior Ophir Sneh, junior Leanne Miron and Paly alumnus Ido Gal. The scripts \u201cHorse Girls\u201d by former student\u00a0Lily Dodd\u00a0and \u201cDo Engineers Dream of Androids?\u201d by Paly alumna Miranda Cohn will also be featured.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's much more fun to work on the student-written scripts because it's not so rigid,\u201d O'Reilly said. \u201cIf you want to do something fun and exciting on one of the plays that is student-written, it's just a matter of asking that person.\u201d\r\n\r\nUnlike\u00a0the traditional fall and spring Paly theater productions, One Acts encourages students who are\u00a0not usual participants of the arts\u00a0to\u00a0perform, according to O'Reilly. For\u00a0senior Clara Chiu who took part\u00a0in theater as a child, this production is\u00a0the perfect occasion to explore acting once more\u00a0through her role in \u201cLove (Awkwardly).\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think One Acts is awesome because it presents the opportunity for people who haven't really done theater or aren't really experienced to have that opportunity to explore it,\u201d Chiu said.\r\n\r\nOne Acts will be performed at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

Hull said that he was able to succeed thanks to an aggressive mentality on the mound. \r\n\r\n\u201cI felt pretty good,\u201d Hull said. \u201cI was ready. Playoffs are always fun. [I] just try to attack hitters.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly struck first with an RBI single by senior right fielder Owen Plambeck, allowing senior third baseman Riley Schoeben to score. \r\n\r\nThe Vikings continued to stretch the lead in the second inning with a triple by senior Lawrence Han, scoring sophomore second baseman Max Jung-Goldberg and senior first baseman Alec Olmstead. Junior center fielder Ben Cleasby also singled, bringing Han home to make the score 4-0.\r\n\r\nPaly piled on five more runs in the third inning, building up a cushion that allowed the Vikings cruise through the rest of the game. \r\n\r\nDespite losing to Los Altos 1-0 earlier in the season, the Vikings felt prepared to take on the Eagles from the get-go, according to Hull.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we were all pretty ready, pretty pumped up about this game, playoffs are obviously a little more high-stakes,\u201d Hull said. \u201cI think we were just confident going in, and we got to them early, and kind of cruised on from there.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team\u2019s win puts them in a good position for their overall ranking at Leagues. \r\n\r\n\u201cIf we win [Leagues], we have Finals next week, and then on to CCS,\u201d Plambeck said. \u201c[We] got them again on Thursday; you have to put them away with a sweep.\u201d\r\n\r\nHull said that the Vikings will be able to win the second game, and thus the series, if they continue their performance from yesterday.\r\n\r\n\u201cLooking ahead to Thursday, hopefully we\u2019ll do something that\u2019s pretty similar: go out, score runs early, and keep doing it,\u201d Hull said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will play game two against the Eagles at 4 p.m. on Thursday at home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School baseball team (20-4-1, 12-2) crushed the Los Altos Eagles (15-12-0, 8-6) 9-0 yesterday at home in the first round of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League playoffs.

The top ten overall, from all of the groups for each event, place internationally.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the international level, we represent California DECA more than anything, all the chapters from each school in the three regions of California unite as one and support each other no matter their attachments to their schools or districts,\u201d Cong said.\r\n\r\nStudents had to have qualified at the state level before representing California in the international competition, according to Cong.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe qualified by placing in the top 4 for our [individual] event at the state competition,\u201d Cong said. \u201cI competed in the Financial Consulting Event, Josh and Samarth competed in the Public Relations Project, Nicholas in Accounting Applications Series and Hannah and Allison in Hospitality and Tourism Operations Research.\u201d\r\n\r\nClub members prepare for competitions, such as ICDC, throughout the year through various methods, including working on written projects or presentations, mock events and role playing, as well as practicing for the multiple choice tests that are included in many events, according to Cong.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Josh Code, the events contain a mixture of presentations, multiple choice tests and reports.\r\n\r\n\u201c[For our project] a judge read our report, evaluated it and then evaluated our 15 minute presentation,\u201d Code said.\r\n\r\nSophomore Nicholas Zhao echoed Cong\u2019s sentiments and excitement about the opportunity of attending the international competition.\r\n\r\n\u201cRepresenting Paly DECA was surreal, especially since it is the first time our school has had people qualify for ICDC,\u201d Zhao said.\u201cThe most memorable moment would be walking into opening ceremony and seeing the 18,000 students that had come from across the globe. Going to ICDC is an amazing experience that every student has the opportunity to have by joining DECA, and I definitely recommend that students join next year.\u201d ","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School's DECA club is optimistic for its next season after sending six members to the International Career Development Conference from April 23 through April 26 in Nashville, Tennessee.","date":"2016-05-03 15:38:26","author":"Zahra Muzaffar","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/13115613_1153956011301681_1538395278_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["competition","DECA","ICDC","International","josh code","Nashville","nicholas zhao","paly","PalyDECA","stephanie cong","student"]},{"id":119726,"title":"ASB puts on annual intramural volleyball tournament","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/03\/asb-puts-on-annual-intramural-volleyball-tournament\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body wrapped up another successful year of the annual intramural volleyball tournament on the Quad from April 25 to April 29, a popular event that attracts many students.\r\n\r\nThis year, 18 teams competed throughout the week at lunch time.
