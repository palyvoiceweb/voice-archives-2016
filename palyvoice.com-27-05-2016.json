Photo: Julia Qiao[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAlthough they may not always train or play together, sophomore Michael Chau and junior Flavia Stiglich are connected by a deeper bond \u2013 their love for badminton.\r\n\r\nIn a short amount of time at Palo Alto High School, Stiglich and Chau have become close friends through their many discussions about their badminton experiences. Both are highly successful players: Chau is nationally ranked in the United States and Stiglich is a member of the Peruvian National Badminton Team.\r\n\r\nTogether, these newcomers have led Paly's badminton team to one of its best seasons in years, including successful showings at the California Interscholastic Federation Northern California Tournament over the weekend.\r\n\r\nChau and senior Eric Chiang placed third in the boys\u2019 double division at CIF-Norcal in San Jose, according to Chau. Senior Priya Misner and junior Stiglich also made it into quarterfinals before falling to a team from Carlmont. Chau and Chiang were seeded third heading into Saturday\u2019s tournament after placing second at Central Coast Section finals and first at Santa Clara Valley Athletic League, according to Chau.\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael Chau: Leader by example\r\n<\/strong>\r\n\r\nChau joined the Vikings this year and quickly helped lead the team to victory. Currently, he is ranked 32nd in the Under-19 age group for Boys' Singles. To be nationally ranked, players must compete in many USA Badminton tournaments. At his peak, Chau was ranked 19th in the nation is his age group playing Boys' Singles.\r\n\r\nChau's mother introduced him to the sport at the age of eight, hoping that he would play a sport that he could not get injured in. Having fallen in love with the sport, Chau has spent the last eight years practicing and honing his technique. He hopes to follow his passion and continue badminton far into the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy ultimate goal is to go to the Olympics, but I do not really know if that will happen,\u201d Chau said. \u201cIt seems really far away, but you have to dream to keep going.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeyond the national tournaments and Olympic dream, Chau has found his spot on Paly\u2019s badminton team. According to assistant coach Arne Lim, he was able to carry the team\u2019s spirit and boost its moral.\r\n\r\n\u201cMichael did not win every single time, yet every time he played, everyone watched him,\u201d Lim said. \u201cWe usually tried to set his match early in the tournament so it [his match] sets the tone for the team, because when he won, everyone said, \u2018Okay, we can do this.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nChau\u2019s talent is well known throughout the team and many members value his expertise.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is kind of a team leader without a title,\u201d Lim said. \u201cHe leads through example and skill. He is a nice guy and a very good team player as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Flavia Stiglich: Leader by teaching\r\n<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Vikings also saw the addition of member Flavia Stiglich, who moved from Peru in December 2015. Although she no longer practices with the Peruvian National Badminton Team, she still represents Peru in international competition, including the Pan American Junior Competition, which she has competed in since 2011, and the World Junior Championships, which she competed in since 2015. Stiglich also represents her country at many Southern American tournaments\u00a0and has been doing so since 2011.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best feeling is when I compete with other countries and compete for my country,\u201d Stiglich said. \u201cBecause then, you are no longer playing for yourself, but also for your country. When you win something, you are serving something bigger than yourself, and that feeling is something I just cannot describe.\u201d\r\n\r\nStiglich first started badminton at the age of 10, and after two years of practice, she decided to try out for the national badminton team in 2011. At first glance, it seems as though Stiglich\u2019s path has been relatively smooth, reaching national success after two years. However, Stiglich has had to overcome many barriers, the biggest being herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore the qualification for the World Junior Championships in 2015, I played a tournament to qualify to the 2015 South American Tournament and did not do as well as expected,\u201d Stiglich said. \u201cMy mental game was off ... so my game was not the level it should have been. During the time between the South American and Worlds qualifications, I had a tough time thinking that I was not going to make it to Worlds and that I was not good enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nStiglich admits that she thought about quitting badminton\u00a0but ultimately decided to continue working towards her goal.\r\n\r\n\u201cI learned to never give up on my dreams,\u201d Stiglich said. \u201cAfter working on my mental strength and confidence, I was able to overcome all the negative thoughts. When the World Junior Championship qualification tournament came around, I was ready to do my best and qualified to represent my country at the championships.\u201d\r\n\r\nLike Chau, Stiglich found her place on the team and soon became a valuable leader on and off the court.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is willing to teach others who are willing to listen,\u201d Lim said. \u201cShe is willing to take some time to root them on, to be part of the team and really support the women who are on our team. People like her a lot and she has got a wonderful personality. She has a very strong charisma that is poised and confident while not overbearing. ... She leads by her knowledge and help.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith Chau and Stiglich at the helm, the team will already have a strong start by the time the spring badminton season rolls around, despite assistant coach Arne Lim leaving.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe expect to have a great season next year,\u201d Lim said. \u201cFlavia is only a junior and Michael is only a sophomore, so they will be playing for us next year as well. We also have some people who are returning next year who took this year off, which will add to our team. It will be a season to watch out for.\u201d","excerpt":"Although they may not always train or play together, sophomore Michael Chau and junior Flavia Stiglich are connected by a deeper bond \u2013 their love for badminton.","date":"2016-05-26 22:31:03","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Flavia-and-michael.jpg","categories":["A&amp;E Section Spotlight","Badminton","Features","Spotlight"],"tags":["#norcal","Arne Lim","badminton","CIF-Norcal","Flavia Stiglich","Michael Chau","paly","season recap","states"]},{"id":120671,"title":"School board representatives to obtain preferential vote","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/26\/school-board-representatives-to-obtain-preferential-vote\/","content":"Pending approval at a meeting in June,\u00a0Board of Education student\u00a0representatives will cast preferential votes during Palo Alto Unified School District board meetings\u00a0starting next school year.\r\n\r\nAccording to Supt.

Teachers and board members have been negotiating matters in regards to teacher salary for months, according to board member Melissa Baten-Caswell. The contract will enact a 5 percent raise from July 2015 for this year, a 4\u00a0percent\u00a0raise in the 2016-17 school year and a 3 percent\u00a0raise in 2017-18. It will also include bonuses to teacher salaries that depend on property tax growth in the area.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the presence of a crowd of Palo Alto Educators Association members, Baten-Caswell expressed her support for the contract.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI am completely in support of this contract,\u201d Baten-Caswell said. \u201cThe thing that makes the biggest difference\u00a0isn\u2019t the buildings textbooks or class sizes, but the teachers.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Dauber, the 12 percent increase is much less desirable than his proposed 9\u00a0percent\u00a0increase, as a smaller increase would allow the district to hire approximately 35 additional teachers, which would decrease class size.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt [the contract] doesn\u2019t strike the balance that we need between reducing class size and continuing\u00a0to get excellent teachers,\u201d Dauber said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board member Camille Townsend denied\u00a0Dauber claim about teacher salary increase linking to\u00a0decreasing class size, which was largely supported by those who attended the meeting.

In return, the race organizers pay a regular fee to the insurance company. Our paper developed a mathematical model that tells insurance companies how much they should charge and tells race organizers the conditions under which it makes financial sense for them to buy, or not buy, that insurance.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zhang attributes the team\u2019s strong performance to its perseverance, as they had to start over multiple times.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cCompeting in a 5-day challenge is a lot like running a marathon,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cBy the end of our time allotted, all of us were exhausted and incoherent in our speech. In almost each of our competitions, we would find a possible solution, only to discover later that it had a fatal flaw. Initially, we were extremely frustrated, but as we became more experienced, we also got used to starting over after failure. I think the ability to rebound is important as a life skill, and for this reason would strongly encourage anyone interested in mathematics to try a math modeling competition, because it really builds perseverance.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Lee, the team felt more prepared for the competition this year than last year. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Another year of math courses, programming classes, and developing problem solving skills in general helped immensely,\" Lee said. \"Last year, we struggled far more with both the development of an abstract solution as well as the technical implementation of our algorithm. This year, there was not as much lag time between reading the problem and completing a thorough response. As a result, we had a lot more time to polish the writing and explanations in the paper. We definitely feel that the last couple hours we spent thoroughly proofreading our paper improved its quality and appeal to the judges.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has used its experience in previous math classes and competitions to incorporate more advanced mathematics into their its solutions, according to Foster.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur model in this paper had a natural opening for the use of partial derivatives, something we only learned in math a few months back,\u201d Foster said. \u201cWe wouldn't have been able to use this in our previous papers because we didn't know how, but they became an important part of our solution for this latest contest, showing how our papers can improve not just with practice but with more exposure to math, as well.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Foster, although the results of the competition are presented as a reflection of the work the team put into the contest, the results are just as much of what they have learned in their math classes throughout Paly.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI'm grateful to have such talented and hardworking teammates in addition to having the support of the math department and the school as we participate in these contests,\u201d Foster said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foster recommends that any students interested in math to try the High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt's [the contest is] fun and also a great way to take what you've learned for so long in school and apply it to a real-world problem that requires math for its solution and, in many cases has not yet been satisfactorily solved,\u201d Foster said. \u201cPaly's Analysis, AB, BC, MV [Multivariable] Calculus, and Statistics courses provide any interested students with the needed mathematical foundations for these contests, and I'm confident any student who can succeed in those courses can succeed in these contests, as well.\"<\/span>","excerpt":"A team of four Palo Alto High School seniors were notified on May 17 that they have been selected as one of the two US representatives for the International Math Modeling Competition, according to math instructional supervisor Radu Toma.\r\n","date":"2016-05-26 11:08:32","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_43931.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["allison","andrew","contest","eric","foster","kathryn","lee","li","math","modeling","radu","toma","win","Zhang"]},{"id":120948,"title":"District plans overhaul of standardized test administration","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/25\/district-plans-overhaul-of-standardized-test-administration\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_120958\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"562\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_5419.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-120958\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/IMG_5419.png\" alt=\"IMG_5419\" width=\"562\" height=\"421\" \/><\/a> Gunn High School school board representative senior Grace Park expressed her thoughts regarding students' frustration of retaking AP exams in her last board meeting. \"The atmosphere on campus is that students are dealing with this simply because that is the only option,\" Park said.

People either love it or hate it for existing outside the black-and-white world. It only takes a few fishbowls and Socratic Seminars to see that it\u2019s often just as easy to prove the converse of a theme using slightly different evidence. Still, exploring all the avenues available to find the hidden meaning in a text can be\u00a0rewarding.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As such, English is a class that is inherently subjective. When analyzed under different rubrics, the same work gets different credit. Distorted by layers of partiality, from interpretation to writing style to a teacher\u2019s own opinion of a thesis, we feel that at Palo Alto High School, equality before the gradebook is not a sufficiently enforced policy. In short, the differences in grading and expectations in English classes at\u00a0Paly are detrimental to students and ultimately result in inaccurate representations of both talent and effort. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we get into the horizontal and vertical alignment alluded to above, we\u2019d like to clarify something. We do not intend to call out any specific English teacher in this article, and we don\u2019t believe any of these teachers are consciously biased. We are extremely grateful to all our English teachers for everything they\u2019ve taught us, from the x-y-z\u2019s of thesis writing to the MLA format of a final paper. The Paly faculty is a passionate, talented group of teachers who all want their students to succeed. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if students are to succeed, Paly needs to have a new policy enforcing alignment, so that every student is given an equal opportunity to learn and excel. Additionally, this kind of adaptation to Paly\u2019s current alignment efforts would also help fulfill the most recent <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/22\/wasc-team-announces-results-of-self-study-report\/\">WASC goals<\/a>\u00a0of systems alignment, student engagement and innovation in the\u00a0English department.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horizontal alignment is the educational practice of ensuring that students taking the same course under different teachers are still learning the same material. This doesn\u2019t solely mean they read similar literature, but that they are taught the same writing techniques and organizational formats. Vertical alignment holds teachers accountable for adequately preparing their students to succeed in the next level course, meaning\u00a0that if a junior year course is open to both regular and honors sophomore students, both should be able to effectively complete the course junior year.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/english-horizontal-alignment.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-120858\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/english-horizontal-alignment.jpeg\" alt=\"english-horizontal-alignment\" width=\"800\" height=\"490\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine this scenario. You read the required book for your class, and after discussions and analysis, you receive an essay prompt, the prompt given to all students in your lane. You write an essay, using the instructions given to you by your teacher. Then you add it to the pile of essays for a different teacher teaching a different period of the same class. Would you be confident your work would get the grade it deserved? Would you bet 10 or 15 or 20 percent of your grade on it? We wouldn\u2019t.\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What isolates English as the least horizontally aligned subject is the lack of common material shared between classes. In STEM classes, differences between two teachers can be frustrating, but at least students have a common textbook or common notes. Reading the same book in two different classes does not guarantee the same knowledge, as the material used to analyze the book can completely change your perspective of the literature.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly\u2019s current departmental policy requires that English teachers hold bimonthly grade-level meetings to discuss how credit should be awarded in each class and other aspects of student learning. Instructional Supervisor Shirley Tokheim finds the grade-level teams to be useful in facilitating cohesion. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen we have collaboration, teachers meet in their grade-level teams and ... talk about creating common assessments, creating a common syllabus \u2026 and [calibrating] essays,\u201d Tokheim said. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite acknowledging room for improvement, Tokheim feels that alignment is not an issue that can be corrected quickly. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s something that takes years and years .\u2026 It\u2019s something that you\u2019re constantly working on and something that our department is constantly working on,\u201d Tokheim said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, we feel that this approach is too passive for such a pervasive problem within the English department. The fact that certain teachers within the same lane are infamous for their intense discussion groups or their emphasis on participation screams inconsistency. Teachers have their own style, and we value learning to adapt to different learning methods, but in past courses we\u2019ve compared our assignments to find completely different resources and templates available. The difference between the basic writing materials provided to us can only mean that our writing is graded differently. The fact that colleges will see the same course on our transcripts, when in actuality our courses are far from the same, is not okay. It\u2019s pretty misleading.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English teacher Julia Taylor cautions that complete uniformity is a dangerous goal when it comes to English alignment.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn English class we have to be really careful because there is a way to take alignment a little bit too far,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhen all the teachers decide that they\u2019re going to be using the exact same terminology \u2026 \u00a0it\u2019s a little problematic because what happens when students go to colleges all over the place and someone uses different terminology? The students don\u2019t have flexibility of thinking.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We feel that there must be a way to achieve this flexibility of thinking while maintaining consistency between classes. English is meant to be a creative subject, but there are ways to find a balance between\u00a0creativity\u00a0and structure. As a first step, we suggest all potential biases are eliminated from the gradebook. We invite teachers to try our scenario above, and adopt Advanced Placement Psychology\u2019s policy of identifying written work by student ID, not name. We personally do not think teachers are biased against students, but this method would prevent students from blaming grades on subjectivity, instead initiating a conversation about what\u2019s actually wrong with poorly graded work.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grades aren\u2019t the only thing hurt by insufficient vertical alignment. Psychology shows that a student\u2019s self-esteem, their confidence in their ability, and their intrinsic motivation to succeed are all damaged when they\u2019re thrown into a class unprepared. Tenth\u00a0grade English teacher Mimi Park explains that this problem is being tackled in the form of Thursday collaborations between the ninth and 10th\u00a0grade levels.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/english-vertical-alignment.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-120865\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/english-vertical-alignment.jpeg\" alt=\"english-vertical-alignment\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n\u201cWith ninth and 10th\u00a0grade discussions, and really this is all I can speak to just on personal experience, we have meetings where\u00a0we talk about expectations and the transition from ninth grade to 10th grade, the skill sets that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Park said.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we applaud the department\u2019s increasing focus on vertical alignment, this focus seems to be struggling to reach the 11th\u00a0and 12th\u00a0grade classes, years with a particularly significant increase in academic rigor. If collaboration in these teacher teams is more difficult, we suggest a set of uniform handouts to set expectations between lanes. A teacher could then prepare students for next year, teaching a few lessons in advance, the same way some math classes spend the last weeks of school going over materials that will be seen in next year\u2019s lane.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While most teachers seem to be working towards goals of alignment, an increase of student feedback could help them get there. Right now, mandatory end-of-year surveys question a single teacher\u2019s skills, but rarely touch on the alignment between classes in the same lane or reflections of students\u2019 satisfaction with their previous class\u2019 preparation for their course. Teachers should do more than just look at the responses to these surveys; there should at least be a department meeting to discuss the results. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We attribute some of these alignment issues to flaws in the department\u2019s solicitation of student feedback. Some of the burden is on students to actually provide constructive feedback instead of just venting. We also suspect that part of the difficulty\u00a0stems from teachers' resistance to examine criticism, and part of it comes from the logistical challenges of collecting this kind of feedback.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, inconvenient truths can only be faced when they come with a side of data, and we hope that the upcoming end-of-year survey is used to evaluate not only individual performance, but the orchestrations of the department as a whole. Alignment may require trial and error, from trying out student IDs on essays to improving\u00a0standardized grade-level expectations, but we believe the Paly English department will handle it well. After all, if there is one thing that English has\u00a0taught\u00a0us, it's that the best work always needs multiple drafts.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"Imagine this scenario.

Photo by Nika Woodfill.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis week the Paly Voice sat down with music enthusiast and Vikapella member senior Jenny Xin, to discuss pop music, her perfect pitch and choir.\r\n\r\nXin has participated in choir for all four years of high school, but claims it has not influenced her music taste substantially, despite its importance to her musical education.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy music taste is independent from choir,\u201d Xin said. \u201cHowever, choir has exposed me to a lot of new ideas musically, and stylistically, and I\u2019ve kind of learned what makes the songs I like listening to catchy. And kind of been able to learn about popular music throughout the ages. Even though I don't listen to a lot of the songs we sing in choir it is definitely really interesting to learn about them and perform and that has definitely broadened my musical horizons.\u201d\r\n\r\nOver the course of Xin\u2019s musical career, she has been able to develop something called perfect pitch.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo perfect pitch is generally like being a glorified tuning fork,\u201d Xin said. \u201cBasically perfect pitch or relative pitch means just being able\u00a0to identify notes by their name, so if you hear the letter C or E or A flat you'll be able to hear that note in your head.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the talent that stems from having perfect pitch, Xin explains that it is more of an annoyance when it comes to listening to music.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gets kind of annoying. It\u2019s not really a help as much as it is a giant pain,\u201d Xin said. \u201cI\u2019ll listen to a radio station and sometimes they'll pitch their songs to avoid copyright issues and so I can kind of realize that it annoys me the whole time.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Xin, she most enjoys listening to high tempo upbeat songs, however, her individual music taste is difficult to categorize.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of the songs I listen to are so different I'm not really sure what the underlying theme is,\u201d Xin said.\" For me, it is to an extent lyrical but also the production behind the song. But mostly I tend to like really upbeat catchy music.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Xin described how her music preference has evolved in high school.\r\n\r\n\u201cI used to think listening to mainstream pop was kind of a guilty pleasure thing, but I think I enjoy more now without too much shame, and I have gotten more into musicals,\u201d Xin said. \u201cMy music taste has definitely developed. Before I would mostly be listening to classical or pop music but now I listen to everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aclairekrugler%3Aplaylist%3A3Z3oH0xrxcXRUJQij2AQbv\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"This week the Paly Voice sat down with music enthusiast and Vikapella member senior Jenny Xin, to discuss pop music, her perfect pitch and choir. <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/24\/tuesday-tunes-jenny-xin\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2016-05-24 23:31:31","author":"Claire Krugler","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/DSC_00081.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Spotlight","Tuesday Tunes"],"tags":["choir","Jenny Xin","music","perfect pitch","Tuesday Tunes","vikapella","wombats"]}]
