The lunchtime rally featured a tug-of-war contest, as well as the usual cheers and a best dressed competition.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, Palo Alto High School's Associated Student Body strayed from tradition and allowed judges to randomly pull the order in which grades would participate in the tug of war from a hat.\r\n\r\nThe seniors quickly defeated the freshmen in the first round of tug of war, while the juniors were victorious over the sophomores. In the consolation round, the freshmen pulled an upset victory over the sophomores.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was impressed and surprised by the fact that the freshmen took third place in tug of war and beat the sophomores,\u201d freshman Griffin Kemp said.\r\n\r\nAfter a hard-fought battle in the championship round, the seniors prevailed over the juniors to claim the win.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur whole team was really pumped because we [the Class of 2017] have never made it to the championship round before,\u201d tug-of-war participant senior Lauren Koyama said. \u201cWe all knew we had to redeem ourselves for the past years.\u201d\r\n\r\nLast year, the Class of 2018 claimed victory while facing the Class of 2017 in the first round. Its win forced the Class of 2017 to compete for third place, rather than the anticipated junior versus senior tug-of-war championship round.\r\n\r\nDespite the loss, the juniors are still optimistic about their Spirit Week chances.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough we lost to the seniors this year, I think our class has a lot of spirit and we can definitely can make a comeback in the next couple days,\u201d junior Xander Sherer said.\r\n\r\nTotal points will be posted at the end of float building on the ASB website at 9:30 p.m. Spirit Week will continue tomorrow with the Night Rally from 7 to 9 p.m. Check The Paly Voice for more updates on Spirit Week 2016 under the new <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.io\/spiritweek16\" target=\"_blank\">Spirit Week tab<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1Qf8Ne0o_uW_nyTNSZOXEJSvSB0ChMy8mXl11kOWuAGo\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"700\" height=\"495\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The competition heats up as seniors performed strongly in today\u2019s lunchtime rally, fueling the feud amongst the upperclassmen.\r\n","date":"2016-10-18 18:24:58","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0238.jpg","categories":["News","Spirit Week 2016","Spotlight"],"tags":["day 2","griffin","griffin kemp","hawaiian","healthy choice","kemp","koyama","lauren","palo alto high school","paly","ranch","recap","sherer","spirit","Spirit Week","toga","tug of war","victory","week","xander"]},{"id":124433,"title":"Spirit Week Day One results","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/17\/spirit-week-day-one-results-3\/","content":"<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/17\/recap-spirit-week-day-one\/\" target=\"_blank\">Spirit Week Day One<\/a> results are in, and the seniors are <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/17\/video-paly-launches-spirit-week-2016\/\" target=\"_blank\">narrowly in the lead<\/a> with 100\u00a0points ahead of the second-place sophomores.

Each theme corresponds with each class\u2019 color: orange for freshmen, red for sophomores, yellow for juniors and green for seniors.\r\n\r\nThis year, the freshman theme is \u201cEye of the Tiger,\u201d the sophomore theme is \u201cFirefighters,\u201d the junior theme is \u201cBoxing\u201d and the senior theme is \u201cGame Over.\u201d Rather than wearing clothes that correspond to their theme, due to Paly tradition, seniors instead wear 90s apparel on Monday.\r\n\r\nThis year, Spirit Week festivities open at lunch on the football field with the lunchtime rally, which will feature three main events: Knee Trembler, Banana Bump and Pass the Water.\r\n\r\nKnee Trembler, a new event to Paly Spirit Week, is a mini relay race consisting of three students from each grade. Using only their knees, students must pick up an orange and hop over to a hula hoop placed on the ground. Whoever has placed the most oranges in the hoop at the end of a minute will win.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Knee Trembler game, the Banana Bump event will take place. This time, only one student from each grade will participate. The student will have a banana tied around his or her waist and must bump an orange, using the banana, past the finish line.\r\n\r\n\"The other new game is Pass the Water,\" ASB Spirit Commissioner Michaela Fogarty said. \"Participants line up and transfer water from one bucket to another by passing it to each other over their heads with cups. The grade with the most water in the final bucket wins.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Fogarty, the results of the events are unpredictable.\r\n\r\n\"None of the grades are projected to win any of the games,\" Fogarty said. \"It should be very competitive and exciting to watch.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the points awarded for the events, class cheers and scores for best dressed will award each grade with extra points. Cheers at each rally can earn up to 800 points for first place and up to 500 points for the best dressed contest.\r\n\r\nUp to 150 points of deductions are possible for sportsmanship and cleanliness.\r\n\r\nFor more information on lunchtime rallies and the Spirit Week scoring system, refer to the <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/pahsasb\/sw2016\" target=\"_blank\">ASB master schedule<\/a>.
