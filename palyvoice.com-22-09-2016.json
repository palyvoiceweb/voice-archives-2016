Chiarello handed down\u00a0this date during a five-minute information and arraignment session for Michael Airo on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor charged Airo with\u00a0four felonies, including one count of continuous sexual abuse of a minor under the age of 14, and three counts of lewd and lascivious acts with the use of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person, according to the San Jose Mercury News.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Airo\u00a0pled not guilty to all charges on July 12.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe victim (Jane Doe), now 24, was 11\u00a0when Airo allegedly started abusing her, according to Palo Alto Online, which added that Doe eventually\u00a0came out about the abuse 10 years later to her psychologist, who then told the police.
