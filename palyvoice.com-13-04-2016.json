Photo: Adrienne Kwok.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School administration is working to repair damage done to multiple buildings after discovering eight shattered windows last Tuesday, according to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson.\r\n\r\nBerkson said he received a call during Spring Break indicating an individual had used a BB gun to shoot at classrooms P6A, P9, P12 and 901, which include science portables and an administrative building. Paly is covering the broken windows with plywood while waiting for the out-of-stock replacements to arrive.\r\n\r\nThe administration is analyzing the extent of the damage before deciding on\u00a0a penalty, according to Berkson. The perpetrators, currently unidentified, could face legal consequences and pay upwards of $1000 in damage. Other repercussions may include suspension, a permanent addition to a student\u2019s record that could affect their college eligibility, says Berkson.\r\n\r\nThe administration may take further legal action, as a BB gun was brought on\u00a0campus. According to the Paly Student Handbook, weapons, including paint ball and squirt guns, are prohibited on campus and could result in PAUSD expulsion and\u00a0arrest per\u00a0the California State Educational Code.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving been a teenager at one time, I understand that kids may sometimes do things that are inappropriate,\u201d Berkson said. \u201cKids should really think about what they are doing before they do it, because the consequences could be a very big deal.\u201d\r\n\r\nOther than a decrease in natural lighting, science teacher Elizabeth Brimhall, whose classroom suffered a broken window, does not believe the vandalism is significantly affecting her teaching.\r\n\r\n\"It's shocking and I think the students were surprised [at the vandalism]\u201d Brimhall said. \u201cFor me, luckily it\u2019s not the only window we have so we have other ways to get light in the room. It [vandalism] has a minor effect except for the fact that it\u2019s a sad thing to have happened.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly is no new victim to vandalism.
