It had only been five minutes into the first half, but the Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 soccer team (4-0, 0-0) was suddenly in charge of the game with a one-goal lead. The game would end without any additional goals from either team, but Verwillow\u2019s early goal was enough to extend the Vikings\u2019 perfect record to four wins.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the 1-0 victory against Menlo-Atherton, the Paly boys\u2019 soccer team envisions continuing its undefeated preseason record against Burlingame High School at 6 p.m. today at home. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Verwillow, the Vikings feel ready for the upcoming match.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe game for today shouldn't be anything too challenging,\u201d Verwillow said. \u201cWe are just coming off a win versus Menlo-Atherton, which is a CCS [Central Coast Section] caliber team every year. So while I can't say for certain how good Burlingame is, I'll be disappointed if we can't pull out a win.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior midfielder and captain Derek Schoenberger agreed with Verwillow\u2019s expectations despite his lack of experience playing against Burlingame.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI'm looking forward to the game today,\u201d Schoenberger said. \u201cI've never played Burlingame before in all four years at Paly, so it's going to nice to see how well we can compete with a team we have no expectations for.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior midfielder Ethan Ho said he believes that a key aspect to the team's early success is warmly welcoming the underclassmen as part of the team.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWith the influx of new sophomores on the team, I think the chemistry in the team is surprisingly good, but this might be partially due to the fact that a lot of us all play on the same club team,\u201d Ho said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior left midfielder Yahli Malchin also credited the team's sterling chemistry due to their comradery formed through outside club teams. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have a lot of guys from the same club team so we're already really close from that and we play well together,\u201d Malchin said. \u201cEveryone has fun playing together and our chemistry is getting better each game.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vikings prepared for this game the same way they have prepared for all their previous games, according to Schoenberger.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"We haven't prepared for this game any different than the previous games,\u201d Schoenberger said. \u201cLike every game, all players are expected to be ready to step onto the field and fight to the last minute for the win.

The Vikings played a strong match despite the loss of significant seniors from last year, including current UCLA freshman star, Jacey Pederson.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think the team is going to focus on advancing our play throughout the season,\u201d Preising said. \u201cWe lost a lot of key players but I think we came out really strong yesterday and I hope we can carry that out through the season.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although today\u2019s game is merely a preseason match, senior defender Lauola Amanoni anticipates a spirited competition due to the cross-town rivalry between the two teams.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGunn and Paly is the best rivalry in Palo Alto, and it is always a fun game to watch and play,\u201d Amanoni said. \u201cSo far though, Paly has gotten the best of Gunn in the recent years we have played them.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior midfielder Emily Tomz echoed the competition that comes with playing a rival.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI definitely think there will be a competitive spirit at the game this Thursday against Gunn,\u201d Tomz said. \u201cAlthough it is a preseason match and they are not in our league, every game counts, and there is a historical Gunn-Paly rivalry that will make this game intense and exciting. Also, the boys soccer team will be there cheering us on, so it's good to know we will have a lot of support from the stands this game.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to senior midfielder Talia Malchin, the Vikings will take this opportunity to display their newly developed talent during the match and to test the team chemistry. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe are really trying to figure out how to play as a team and I think the game versus Gunn will be a great opportunity to do so,\u201d Malchin said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had very much time to practice in game situations, so the game will be a good time to get down chemistry. We know how Gunn plays because we\u2019ve played them before, so I think our focus will be on team play.

She dribbled deftly past multiple Gunn High School defenders, using her foot skills to advance towards the goal. Preising looked up just in time to see freshman Chloe Japic making a cut and passed a leading ball to her. Japic took a few small touches and wound up a shot at the goal. Needless to say, she took care of the rest.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Japic\u2019s goal asserted the Palo Alto High School (4-0, 0-0) \u00a0girls\u2019 soccer team\u2019s dominance in the first half, giving the Vikings a 1-0 lead against the Titans (1-2-1, 0-0) at the Gunn field last Thursday night. Preising later scored a goal off a header from a corner kick by junior Emily Tomz in the second half, extending Paly\u2019s lead to 2-0. Gunn made a late goal, but it was not enough to make a comeback, and the game ended with a score of 2-1.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Preising, playing against Gunn was an exciting matchup, despite the game being part of the preseason schedule.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPlaying Gunn is always fun and it's always been a good experience,\u201d Preising said. \u201cI love playing them [Titans], and I am definitely glad to take part in this rivalry.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly girls' soccer coach Jon Seedman expressed his opinion on the competition between Paly and Gunn.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGunn always gives us their best shot,\u201d Seedman said. \u201cI think if Gunn goes through its season and loses every game but beats Paly, that is a successful season for them. You can definitely see it in their [Gunn players\u2019] eyes and with the way they played. They were extremely pumped up. If you looked at the faces of the winning team and losing team and didn\u2019t know who won, you would've thought the opposite way. They were so happy that they had given us a battle. It's not that much of a rivalry for us as much as it is for them.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preising said while playing the game, she observed what the team\u00a0needs to work on for the future.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI thought we would score more goals because we kept possession in their attacking third quite often and we took a lot of shots,\u201d Preising said. \u201cThe team dynamic isn\u2019t as great as it needs to be but I think the team looks forward to improving that. We definitely need to work on shooting. We had multiple opportunities for easy shots but we chose to pass instead. We don\u2019t have many players who like to shoot so that is something we need to work on as a team.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Preising believes that the struggles will sort itself out through practice and as the season develops.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seedman also commented that the team can work to build its chemistry with the younger players on the team.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey are great socially but when we\u2019re playing, we\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d Seedman said. \u201cChloe [Japic] really played well and scored our first goal. She made a lot of other good plays but she needs to figure out the way we play as a team, but that will come.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team (4-0, 0-0) beat the Gunn High School Titans (0-2-1, 0-0) last Thursday night at Gunn by a score of 2-1.","date":"2016-12-08 09:31:55","author":"Sam Lee","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/emily-tomz-2.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["chloe japic","emily tomz","freshman","gunn","Jon Seedman","paly","preseason","recap","Tess Preising","titans","vikings","win"]},{"id":126955,"title":"Boys&#8217; soccer defeats Menlo-Atherton in tight match","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/08\/boys-soccer-defeats-menlo-atherton-in-tight-match\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_127022\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/DSC_0170.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-127022\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/DSC_0170.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_0170\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> Palo Alto High School senior Charles Stoksik races against a Menlo-Atherton player, trying to keep the ball away from the Viking's goal on Tuesday at Paly.

He later injured his neck after colliding with a Menlo-Atherton player's shoulder. However, after sitting out for a while, he substituted in and made several key plays during the second half.\r\n\r\nHis teammate, sophomore outside midfielder Kenzo Morabia nearly scored another goal, but it was not counted as he\u00a0was ruled offsides. Senior captain Derek Schoenberger also made an attempt to score during the second quarter, but was thwarted by Menlo-Atherton\u2019s goal keeper. Despite an aggressive first half, the Vikings tapered off at the end of the first half of the game, working to preserve their lead.\r\n\r\n\"During the first half we were very aggressive offensively and we attacked hard, especially in the first 20 or so minutes when we got the goal,\" senior Yahli Malchin said. \"After that we kind of dropped back and tried to defend the lead, so the second half was more conservative than the first.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the second half, Schoenberger received a yellow card after tripping a Menlo-Atherton player and thus conceding a free kick. However, the Vikings easily blocked the strike, and the close match continued, with both sides continuously trading possession.\r\n\r\nIn the last two minutes of the game, senior Charles Stoksik also received a yellow card, but quickly returned to the game.\r\n\r\n\"Defensively we felt very solid despite a few close calls, and offensively we did definitely lack a bit,\" Verwillow said. \"We put [senior] Michel Ange Siaba, who usually plays forward for us, [as goal] keeper ... just to ensure we didn't make any mistakes back there, [since] he is a great keeper.\"\r\n\r\nSenior goal keeper Michel Ange Siaba made multiple saves during the game. He and the Vikings' defense worked hard to stave off any further attempts by Menlo-Atherton to score.\r\n\r\nDespite a scoreless second half, Siaba believes his team played well.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was one of those games that tells us will happen\u00a0at CCS [Central Coast Sectionals playoffs], because MA [Menlo-Atherton] is one of those teams that always makes it to CCS,\u201d Siaba said. \u201cThere is a good chance that once we go to CCS, we would have to play them, and this was a good determinant of how it is going to be.\u201d\r\n\r\nVerwillow agreed stating that winning this game was a taste of the competition during CCS.\r\n\r\n\"That was a tough team, ... so it [was] a good check to see how we will be able to compete come the end of the season,\" he said. \"I was satisfied with how we played, mostly just glad to get the win.\"\r\n\r\nThe team's next game will be at 6 p.m. tomorrow at Paly against Burlingame High School.","excerpt":"As the clock ticked down, players raced down the field, one trying to keep the ball, the other looking for a moment of weakness to steal it.

This year, we have a group of guys that have been playing together for years and a fresh new group of underclassmen.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of the departed seniors included the team's goalkeeper, Eli Friedlander, leaving a large hole in the Vikings' defensive roster.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith no clear starting goalie at this point, there are a couple a good options ... but we have yet to see them in games, and it's hard to replace someone like [last year\u2019s goalie],\u201d senior team captain Neil Verwillow said.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Vikings have gained many new seniors,\u00a0 who were inspired to join as it dawned on them this was their last year to play for\u00a0Paly, according to Verwillow. Four seniors as well as five juniors and sophomores will be joining this year's roster.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"_5yl5\">\"I had played for my club team the last three years during the winter, but I decided to play [high school] soccer with my friends in my last year,\" senior Nicholas Camarena said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe guys coming out are very good, so if anything, I believe we have the potential to be even more competitive than last year despite the loss,\u201d Verwillow said.\r\n\r\nVerwillow is excited for another shot at the CCS championship, and encourages student to attend the games.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a blast when people come out to the games and it makes us all play that much harder,\u201d Verwillow said. \u201cI also can't wait for another chance at CCS, no matter what it takes to get there.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeyond doing well in CCS, the team also has goals to develop stronger team bonds.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn past years we've had great groups of individual players, but never really a strong holistic team,\u201d Schoenberger said. \u201cThis year one thing [that] seniors are trying to change is the attitude that is carried throughout the year of not only playing lights out during games, but during practices too.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings played their first preseason game on Nov. 21 against Mountain View, winning 3-0.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we played pretty well ... there is definitely lots of room for improvement,\u201d junior Xander Sherer said. \u201cI think it was a good opportunity for some of the new players to get a feel for varsity game play.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team also recently went against Milpitas High School on Nov. 29, winning, 9-0, as well as defeating Carlmont High School, 2-1, on Nov. 30.\r\n\r\nThe team's next preseason game will be at 3:30 p.m. today at home against Menlo-Atherton High School.

These rigorous matches served as solid preparation for the season ahead and were ultimately crucial in helping the girls acclimate to the new roster.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior outside hitter Denise\u00a0Ringwalt, once the season officially began, the girls began to better combine their talents and work together.\r\n\r\n\"I think the team this year was filled with extremely talented girls that worked together better and better as the season went on,\" Ringwalt said.\r\n\r\nOnly the Los Altos High School Eagles (22-15, 7-5), out of all of the teams in the De Anza League, were able to defeat\u00a0the Vikings, who finished the league with a remarkable\u00a0record of 11-1.\r\n\r\nThe season had several high points, including a nail-biting match against the Eagles in which the Vikings won each set 25-22, and shattered a three-year losing streak to the Eagles.\r\n\r\nDespite having an excellent season, Los Gatos High School Wildcats (20-16, 7-5)\u00a0overpowered the Vikings in the Central Coast Section\u00a0championship match.\u00a0According to Ringwalt, the loss was unexpected and unfortunate for the hard working Vikings, and the injury of junior outside hitter Chelsea Fan was a key factor in the\u00a0defeat.\r\n\r\n\"The CCS championships was a really difficult loss,\" Ringwalt said.\u00a0\"The team worked really hard, but when Chelsea got hurt, everyone kinda fell apart.\"\r\n\r\nFan said despite not making it as far as she had hoped, she is proud of the team and what it accomplished this season.\r\n\r\n\"A couple injuries toward the end made it [the season] end a little sooner than it truly should have, but overall I'm happy with how far we went this year compared to previous seasons,\" Fan said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings must say goodbye to many talented seniors, including\u00a0setters\u00a0Cassie Fong and Jessica Lee, and outside hitters Fiona Green and Katie Passarello. Fan said the seniors performed well throughout the year and will be tough to replace.\r\n\r\n\"The seniors were a huge part of our team this year and they contributed a lot on the court,\" Fan said. \"Next year we'll definitely have trouble filling their spots.\"\r\n\r\nThe team as a whole\u00a0displayed excellent chemistry on and off the court, which was a significant strength and advantage.\u00a0According to Fan, returning Paly players built upon chemistry that they formed during the previous year.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of girls who started this year played together last season so our on-court team chemistry was great,\" Fan said.\r\n\r\nThis chemistry will play a role in the strength of the Vikings next season, who will take their experience this year and continue to\u00a0work to create another high-level team.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School volleyball team is celebrating  an impressive overall record of 23-11 and a successful season, which ended after a loss to the Turlock High School Bull Dogs (28-12, 10-2) in the first round of the States competition.","date":"2016-12-04 20:56:31","author":"William Sallomi","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/VB-VS-Gunn.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["CCS","Chelsea Fan","deedee ringwalt","season recap","sports","volleyball"]},{"id":126695,"title":"Verbatim: What&#8217;d you do over the Thanksgiving break?","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/04\/verbatim-whatd-you-do-over-the-thanksgiving-break\/","content":"Last week, Palo Alto High School students and faculty enjoyed a break from school for the Thanksgiving holiday.
