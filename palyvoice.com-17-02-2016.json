It remained defensively strong and did not let Fremont have many opportunities to try to score.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings raised their level of play to achieve what they\u00a0have\u00a0worked for throughout this season despite setbacks, according to junior captain and defender Neil Verwillow.\r\n\r\n\"What makes our team great is that we are always trying to progress,\" Verwillow said. \"Every game and every practice we step up, and I think we did really well seeing as so many of us have gotten injured these last few weeks.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings had struggled in recent weeks with multiple tied games, but the team earned its win over Fremont, according to senior midfielder Siddharth Srinivasan.\r\n\r\n\"We played very well,\" Srinivasan said. \"We clinched league today and I think we played solid all the way through the game.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to senior captain and goalkeeper Eli Friedlander, winning the league title\u00a0came as a result of all of the work the players have put in throughout the season.\r\n\r\n\"It feels great [to win league],\" Friedlander said. \"We've been working on this all season and league sums up the entire season so far.

Photo: 20th Century Fox.[\/caption]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In \"The Revenant,\" director\u00a0Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu returns after winning\u00a0the Academy Award for Best Picture for \"Birdman\" last year to share a gut-wrenching journey of a man fighting against the unstoppable forces of nature to achieve vengeance.<\/p>\r\nThe movie follows the mostly true story of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), an expert tracker and hunter who suffers from a violent bear attack during a fur-trapping expedition in the 1820s. His companion, John Fitzgerald (Tom Harding), leaves him in the forest to die after killing Glass's son (Forrest Goodluck), who tries to fight Fitzgerald. Glass becomes a legend when he manages to claws his way through thousands of miles of frozen wasteland with open wounds on\u00a0a\u00a0hunt for vengeance. A story of adversity and justice is eclipsed by one of personal development and rebirth, as every imaginable obstacle is thrown at Glass, only for us to see him emerge alive, but barely breathing.\r\n\r\nDicaprio\u2019s performance is raw and haunting. The audience watches him scrape marrow out of frozen bones, catch a fish with his bare hands and cling for his life on a piece of driftwood at the whims of an immense river, and as we root for him all the way. Despite roughly a dozen lines of dialogue, DiCaprio maintains a strong vigor in his eyes that chills to the bone. In the end, this is DiCaprio's film through and through; he is completely committed in every terrifying moment, pushing himself further than he ever has before as an actor and proving himself more than deserving of that \"overdue Oscar.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The supporting cast's performance is equally raw and truthful, particularly that of Tom Harding, who manages to encompass the villain of lawless and ruthless\u00a0frontiersmen, as well as Domhnall Gleeson, who plays the solemn and well-intended captain of the fur-trapping expedition. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of what makes watching \"The Revenant\" more entertaining is knowing the cast and crew of the survival story also went through multiple struggles to make it. I\u00f1arritu took the cast and crew on a nine-month shoot in the wildernesses Alberta and Argentina. What's more, contrary to the norm, he insisted on filming in chronological order and in natural light.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Revenant\u201d is not for the light-hearted. The gore and blood encompasses the rough and uncertain reality of life on the frontier during that time. This further heightens the intensity of this gripping survival story.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the greatest achievements of the film is the way it manages to juxtapose the immense beauty of nature to the unforgiving conditions of life that stumbles alongside it. This is made possible through the sublime cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, who captures the the dark brutality of man in a scene when DiCaprio first finds the body of his son. The ragged breaths of a barely-breathing man fog up the camera lens as Dicaprio gazes at his son\u2019s body, serving to embody the panic and rawness of his\u00a0emotions. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lubezki effectively proceeds to sweep us up in the ineffable beauty of nature, showcasing static shots of snow dripping from the tips of evergreen trees and vast expanses of iced valleys and churning rivers. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie plays on the contrast between nature and man; every step of the journey feels treacherous yet simultaneously\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beautiful.<\/span>\r\n\r\nI\u00f1arritu turns a gruelling frontier mythology into an ethereal, treacherous odyssey that continues to linger in your mind, haunting, for days after.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Revenant\u201d is nominated for the following 11 Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Director, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Cinematography, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Film Editing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Costume Design, Best Sound Editing, Best Production Design, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Mixing. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Revenant\u201d deserves to win \u201cBest Picture,\u201d \u201cBest Actor<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Director\u201d and \u201cBest Cinematography\" for its\u00a0ability to capture an audience with gripping\u00a0camera work and its raw and authentic performances.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u201cThe Revenant\u201d<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2 hours, 36 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated:\u00a0Rated R for strong frontier combat and violence including gory images, a sexual assault, language and brief nudity <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by\u00a0Alejandro G.

The story, based on true events, takes place at the height of the Cold War as both the United States and the Soviet Union\u00a0grapple with fear and suspicion. The plot centers on a Brooklyn-based artist, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who is found to be a Russian spy. This threatening discovery affirms America\u2019s worst fears and causes an outbreak of panic and hatred.\r\n\r\nAlthough Abel seems destined to \u00a0hang, the government attempts to display the superiority of democracy by ensuring him a fair trial. They assign him a successful insurance lawyer, James Donovan (Tom Hanks). Hanks\u00a0plays his typical character masterfully\u2014he\u2019s charismatic, approachable, but not afraid to shake things up. Due to his respect for the fundamentals of due process, Donovan agrees to the case. To his surprise he develops a personal connection with Abel. Hanks and Rylance\u2019s on-screen chemistry is part of what makes the movie so captivating.\r\n\r\nAs Abel's unfortunate fate looms closer, across the country an American spy plane disguised as a weather plane is shot down over the Soviet Union. Suddenly Abel has a hope for a prisoner exchange.\r\n\r\nThe film is long, in typical Spielberg manner, and the beginning is at times\u00a0uneventful, trading action for obvious symbolism and intricate camerawork. Yet the second half, when Donovan is sent to a post-war Berlin, turns out to be the most enthralling, insightful part of the film. Donovan is asked by the U.S. government to work as a third party to arrange the swap. He must travel through both devastated East and West Berlin, as beautiful cinematography captures the stark differences in the two sides both visibly and economically even just after the wall has come up; The West is filled with tantalizing stores and light, and the east dark and hazy with young gangs on every corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cBridge of Spies\u201d received six Oscar nominations this year for \u201cBest Picture,\u201d \u201cBest Original Score,\u201d \u201cBest Production Design,\u201d \u201cBest Sound Mixing,\u201d\u201cBest Original Screenplay,\u201d as well as \u201cBest Actor in a Supporting Role,\u201d for Rylance\u2019s performance as Abel.\r\n\r\nRylance delivers an exceptional yet nuanced performance, often overshadowed by more dramatic dialogue. While his performance\u00a0is notable, its\u00a0subtlety will most likely take away Rylance\u2019s prospect of winning \u201cBest Actor in a Supporting Role,\u201d especially considering the other strong candidates.\r\n\r\nBoth Hanks and Rylance give stellar performances, yet the real treasure of \u201cBridge of Spies\u201d is the portrayal of ethical uncertainty Donovan must face. While American society and media easily paint Abel as a communist villain, Donovan can see he\u2019s truly just a patriot, doing what he must for his country.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Bridge of Spies\"<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2 hours 21 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated PG-13 for some violence and profanity<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by Steven Spielberg<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Starring Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Alan Alda, Amy Ryan, and Billy Magnussen<\/strong>","excerpt":"In \"Bridge of Spies,\" Tom Hanks portrays James Donovan, an affluent American lawyer who has been asked to defend a Soviet spy.

Performances ranged from solos to small groups to larger groups and included a San Francisco-themed medley that was performed by the Beginning Choir.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Bay Area needs a little Bay Area love,\u201d Najar said. \u201cWith all sorts of things happening, like the Super Bowl coming to town, it just seemed like the right time to do a Bay Area theme.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Pops Concert, unlike other concerts, is much more casual and allows the students to express themselves through the music that they select\u00a0to perform, according to Najar.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey choose the music,\u201d Najar said. \u201cThey work on it. They rehearse with each other. They work through all the problems that a regular musician would have in putting together a concert.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Taylor Duncan, the Pops Concert allows the students to form a community.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the concert where it\u2019s super laid back and it\u2019s not so choral-heavy,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cWe get to know\u00a0everyone in the choir and in Beginning Choir and in all the different groups a lot more. It\u2019s awesome that we really get to connect in this concert.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe entire choir sported tie-dye shirts, which were hand-made last Friday after school on the Quad in an activity led by junior Spencer Wycoff.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Najar got a bunch of blank shirts with the Paly Pops Concert logos on them, so we tie-dyed them on Friday after school,\u201d Wycoff said. \u201cThe shirts that look extra dope are the ones that I made.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Pops Concert was the last that the Paly choirs will perform in the Haymarket Theater, according to Najar.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do next year,\u201d Najar said. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the Haymarket, but things are going to change so we\u2019re excited about the change.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to senior Sean Jawetz, choir is a great way to create art, and this experience is enriched by the Pops Concert.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the Pops Concert] really turns choir from a class into a community,\u201d Jawetz said. \u201cI will definitely continue to do choir in college because I think that choir is a great art form that allows you to express yourself and do something fun.\u201d","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School choirs performed their annual Pops Concert with a Bay Area music-themed focus on Wednesday in the Haymarket Theater.","date":"2016-02-14 16:06:34","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_5245.jpg","categories":["Entertainment"],"tags":[]}]
