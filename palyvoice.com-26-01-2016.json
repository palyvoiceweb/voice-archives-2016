According to the Palo Alto High School course catalog, \"The Social Justice Pathway is a three-year program featuring self-direction and project-based learning in an interdisciplinary\u00a0model rooted in community action and collaboration.\" Photo by Cooper Lou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnticipating an influx in the number of students enrolled in the district, the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education has been contemplating a series of proposals to build new schools to accommodate a larger student population. At the school board meeting on Jan. 6, the Enrollment and Management Advisory Committee, created to conduct research on school sizes and overcrowding, recommended further exploration of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pausd.org\/sites\/default\/files\/pdf-faqs\/attachments\/EMACSecondarySubcommitteeFinalReport.pdf\">five different proposals<\/a>, one of which calls for building a new high school that emphasizes project-based learning at the Cubberley Community Center. While we appreciate the effort that has gone into researching solutions to the problem, we believe that the district should not adopt the plan to transform Cubberley into an \u201cinnovative school\u201d that will benefit only a relative few. Instead, it ought to focus its attention on expanding project-based learning opportunities at existing high schools.\r\n\r\nProject-based learning is a hands-on classroom approach in which students actively explore real-world problems in the form of research, projects and presentations.\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Increased access to project-based learning\u00a0would be a welcome addition to Palo Alto schools, but the more pressing issue is overcrowding, and the board should be directing its time and resources accordingly. All of the five EMAC recommendations included a provision to build another school, but not one suggested focusing on expanding the physical capacity of Gunn and Palo Alto High School or hiring more instructors. The reality is that district funding is finite, and the millions of dollars\u00a0of\u00a0annual operational costs for the\u00a0proposed high school would best be spent improving the current high schools. In fact, the city has already taken steps to increase\u00a0funds for existing schools \u2014 last year, Palo Alto passed <\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http:\/\/pausd-web.pausd.org\/community\/2015MeasureA\/index.shtml\">Measure A<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">, which established a parcel tax. The revenue will be used to hire more teachers and keep class sizes small, which is a path we should continue to take.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, several problems will arise if Cubberley is to be a transformed into an innovative school \u2014 first and foremost is the issue of funding. Providing students at the new school with the smaller class sizes and breadth of course offerings recommended by the EMAC will require spending more dollars per student, which is in direct conflict with <a href=\"http:\/\/pausd-web.pausd.org\/community\/board\/Policies\/downloads\/BP6171_TitleI.pdf\">Board Policy 6171<\/a>. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have a commitment in the school board for equal funding for students across each of our schools,\u201d said board member Ken Dauber, who agrees that the district should focus on improving the current schools, rather than building another one, in an interview with The Paly Voice. \u201cSo it\u2019s not possible for us to spend more money per student. The alternative that I have heard is using private funding to make up the difference and supplement the spending so that we\u2019re not spending more public dollars per student. This is also not possible under our current policies, because we don\u2019t want to create a fundraising arms race between schools where they raise money for their own students, more so than other schools, creating inequity.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the proposal could be modified so that the costs of the new school are in accordance with Board Policy 6171, which is improbable, money and time would still be better directed toward solving the numerous other pressing problems in the district, like Gunn's\u00a0ineffective advisory system, oversized\u00a0classes, limited access\u00a0to project-based learning and the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/29\/school-board-discusses-achievement-gap-solutions\/\">achievement gap<\/a>\u00a0\u2014 the discrepancy in\u00a0academic performance between socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged students. Overcrowding is certainly an issue, but it is not the only one. The district needs to prioritize.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not seem so, the opening of a new high school with the lottery system could\u00a0create a socio-economic inequality that we see in the district's other lottery schools, Ohlone Elementary and Hoover Elementary Schools. On average,\u00a08.95% of students in the district's elementary schools\u00a0are socio-economically disadvantaged, according to\u00a0the most <a href=\"http:\/\/pausd-web.pausd.org\/community\/about\/sar.shtml\">recent School Accountability Report Cards<\/a>, compared to the significantly lower 3.5% at Ohlone, and 5.1% at Hoover. A\u00a0lottery system theoretically\u00a0ensures equal opportunity for all students, but realistically speaking, current and past trends show that less\u00a0socio-economically disadvantaged\u00a0students will apply than\u00a0what should be\u00a0considered equal. The district should avoid pursuing\u00a0a\u00a0project that could potentially\u00a0exacerbate the achievement gap.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the proposed high school would be able to hold about 400-600 students, which, considering the amount of money that would have to be spent, is a negligible dent in the projected maximum of 4100 high school students districtwide. Since the school would be so much smaller than both Paly and Gunn, enrollment would likely have to be determined through a lottery system. It seems contrary to the goals of the district to spend disproportionate amounts of money on a venture that only stands to benefit a select few. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a new high school entirely is impractical at this point in time, but it is possible that in the next several years, the increase in student population necessitates opening another campus. If the district goes down this path, the new school should be similar to Paly and Gunn in regards to its structure and course offerings, rather than an exclusively project-based learning school.<\/span>\r\n\r\nProponents for the new school argue that many students feel disconnected from their learning, and are looking for a more personal education experience which can be provided at\u00a0a new school. Although it is true that 5%\u00a0of students at <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B0Te89oAASzOTU9wZjdrTkJ3X0U\/view\">Paly <\/a>and 9% of students at <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B0Te89oAASzOZHQtbFBGZ05vSXc\/view\">Gunn <\/a>have little to no engagement in\u00a0learning according to a survey by the school board in cooperation with Stanford, it would be significantly\u00a0more cost efficient to create more non-traditional, project-based learning opportunities at the current schools. The district can explore creating additional programs similar to the Social Justice Pathway or the Sports Career Pathway that provide students with a more personalized learning experience, while\u00a0increasing innovative educational opportunities for all students. At the same time, creating more of such pathways would draw students out of traditional classes, and effectively lessen class sizes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We should be directing our time and energy toward enhancing the learning experience for the entire student body, rather than getting swept up in the novelty of a specialty school that will serve only a small sector of the population.<\/span>","excerpt":"We believe that the district should focus its attention on expanding project-based learning opportunities at existing high schools, rather than adopting the plan to transform Cubberley into an \u201cinnovative school\u201d that will benefit only a relative few.","date":"2016-01-25 19:11:00","author":"The Paly Voice","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/unnamed1.jpg\nmodel rooted in community action and collaboration.&quot; Photo by Cooper Lou.\" \/>","categories":["Editorial","Opinion","Opinion Editor's Pick","Spotlight"],"tags":[]},{"id":114855,"title":"Recap: Boys&#8217; soccer defeats Santa Clara 2-0 and continues streak","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/25\/recap-boys-soccer-defeats-santa-clara-2-0-and-continues-streak\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_114916\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"273\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-25-at-11.22.45-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-114916 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-25-at-11.22.45-PM.png\" alt=\"The Vikings went on to win 2-0, maintaining an undefeated league record today after school at Palo Alto High School in a game against Santa Clara High School.

Born on June 24, 1955, in San Jose, Mr. Scott\u2019s dream job as a child was to be president of the United States. Rather than sleeping with a pillow, he spent most nights with Jojo,<span style=\"color: #007f00;\">\u00a0<\/span>his beloved stuffed animal monkey, the younger Scott said, adding that she recalled that her father's family made an appearance on one of the early episodes of Family Feud; the Scott family was eliminated after his brother Jon Scott was unable to correctly identify a Jewish holiday.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Scott could be found during his childhood summers working at Bay Meadows, a horse racing track in San Mateo that closed in 2008. He graduated from Pioneer High School in San Jose before attending the University of California at Berkeley, where he majored in Earth Sciences. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those that were close to him, especially his high school students, know just how attached he was to exploring the outdoors and spreading awareness about environmental issues. He rode his bike to Paly every morning alongside hundreds of students, even during the rainy season when many students would catch a ride with their parents during a downpour. In class, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to put lessons on hold to discuss and monitor current environmental events going on at a local or even international level. He valued the importance of not just teaching his students about the environment, but encouraging them to apply classroom lessons to the real world. Many of his extra credit assignments involved researching newsworthy environmental topics or going to the Palo Alto Baylands to explore natural habitats.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"When we would go on trips he would always stop and look at rocks,\" Emily Scott recounted. \"He was very into rocks and fossils.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His first job teaching was at Charles Armstrong School in Belmont, a school for children with special needs, according to his daughter. It was during this time when he met his wife, Katherine, to whom he was married to for approximately 18 years until their divorce. Outside of teaching, he loved doing crossword puzzles, reading newspapers, discovering new music and playing games with his two daughters.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Paly, he taught a variety of subjects including physics, chemistry, and most notably, Advanced Placement Environmental Science, popularly for over 18 years, beginning in 1985. According to his daughter, he left Paly in 1991 to work for Apple in the technology industry before returning to the classroom in 2003. He supervised numerous clubs over the course of his time at Paly, and was the Paly Environmental Club adviser at the time of his passing. He also served as Paly\u2019s student activities director in the late 1980s.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss for our community and our school,\u201d Paly principal Kim Diorio said. \u201cHe was a great man, great teacher. I\u2019m personally going to miss him tremendously.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to his meaningful lessons in science, Mr. Scott will be widely remembered for his classroom traditions. On Friday afternoons, he would lead his classes in a \u201cTGIF\u201d chant to celebrate the beginning of the weekend. His most beloved teaching tradition is simply known as \u201cThe Clap.\u201d To begin class, he would stand up in the front of the room and start clapping in a rhythm that his students would soon replicate in unison. After a few rounds of clapping, he would welcome his class and begin doing what he did best, helping high school students become not just smarter thinkers, but better people.<\/span>\r\n\r\nHe is survived by his parents, Joan and Jerry Scott; sister Laurie Burmeister; brothers Joe and Jon Scott; daughters Emily and Elizabeth Scott; and his partner, Sara Tanous.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students and colleagues say it will be a long time before we come across another teacher who leads the clap, spreads environmental optimism and inspires students the way Mr.\u00a0Scott did.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"People loved him, and I don't think he will be forgotten,\" junior Emily Read said. \"[Principal] Kim Diorio came to visit our class, and she was in tears. She was crying so hard, and I could see the connection that he had made being here for so long. He impacted so many people.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1182669811\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Saturday\u2019s<\/span><\/span> celebration of life event for Mr. Scott, originally scheduled for the Quad but moved to the MAC out of concern for the weather, will begin at <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1182669812\"><span class=\"aQJ\">2 p.m.<\/span><\/span>\u00a0Attendees are encouraged to wear blue and gold clothing, the colors of his alma mater, UC Berkeley.<\/span>","excerpt":"Recently, Palo Alto High School lost one of its most beloved teachers, Kenyon Scott.

It\u2019s important because if flooding coincides with a Baylands supertide, flooding could be worse.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, families can gather supplies, according to Lee. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s better to have a plan and not need it,\u201d Lee said. \u201cPeople can prepare if they live in a flood zone by stocking on emergency supplies like flashlights, candles, bottled water, canned food for people and pets, other supplies like a wrench in case they need to turn off their gas and knowing how to turn it off.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other preparations include purchasing plastic tarps and sandbags, putting things high up off the ground, and arranging for pet care, according to Lee.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who are interested in either providing or seeking shelter can contact Lee at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:liz@funghi.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">liz@funghi.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"In light of the increase of rain that El Ni\u00f1o brings, a Palo Alto High School parent is aiming to provide shelter for Paly families at risk of flooding.","date":"2016-01-21 18:14:35","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/2.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["El nino","evacuation","flood","high school","palo alto","paly"]},{"id":114557,"title":"Teachers defeat students at Winter Rally","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/21\/teachers-defeat-students-at-winter-rally\/","content":"The teachers defeated the senior class at the first student vs. staff soccer game during the Winter Rally last week.

Senior goalie Matt O\u2019Reilly was disappointed with the game's final outcome but thinks the students played well overall. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don\u2019t think the game went quite as expected,\" O'Reilly said. \"We were hoping to win.
