An email was sent out to parents by Assistant Principal Kathie Laurence reiterating this message.\r\n\r\n\"We want to make you aware that your student may participate tomorrow in a student-initiated event scheduled during school hours,\" Laurence stated. \"While we respect their freedom of speech and passion, we reminded them today that Flex time is instructional time, and they are supposed to be on campus.\"\r\n\r\nStudents were made aware of this information earlier in the day via a Schoology message, also posted by Laurence.\r\n\r\n\"We ask that you consider staying on campus tomorrow as we are responsible for your safety,\" Laurence stated.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the prospect of cutting Flex may deter students, Morita encourages people to come out and join the march.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI understand that some people do not want a cut,\" Morita said. \"However, this is a small setback compared to people who fear for their family and do not feel safe at home. By coming out you are showing that you are committing to protecting your friends, peers and community.\"<\/span>","excerpt":"In response to the recent presidential election results, a rally organized by Palo Alto High School students to promote acceptance and equality will take place at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow at Lytton Plaza.","date":"2016-11-14 19:43:58","author":"Maya Reuven","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/15058791_1177703345639085_1867680709_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight","Uncategorized"],"tags":["acceptance","election","flex","love","march","peace","protest","Trump","tuesday","unity","walkout"]},{"id":126019,"title":"Season Recap: Boys\u2019 water polo falls in CCS first round","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/14\/season-recap-boys-water-polo-falls-in-ccs-first-round\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_123652\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"646\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0027.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-123652\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0027.jpg\" alt=\"Senior field player Eric Maser scores on a volley from the left side of the pool in the 1st quarter.

The golfers competed for the last open individual spot at CIF.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite seeing her season end along with her teams, Yu remains happy with the end result. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think we had a really strong team this year,\u201d Yu said. \u201cI was really hoping that we would be able to make it to States, but making it to NorCal was already pretty great, since we only made it to CCS last year.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choi has a slightly different view from Yu. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the team for making it that far even though we didn\u2019t play as well as we could\u2019ve,\" Choi said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Choi says she believes that the team\u2019s main focus should be tournament practice.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe definitely need to practice more and be prepared for big tournaments,\u201d Choi said. \u201cWe also need to play more 18-hole courses as a team because it's different from playing \u00a0nine-hole courses.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nine-hole courses are the standard matches that the Vikings played during the regular season against other schools.

On Nov. 3, two days after the deadline, advisory was held\u00a0for seniors for the first time in over two months. \u00a0This ineffective\u00a0schedule has led to confusion and stress for seniors currently going through the college application process.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly created the Teacher Advisor system in part, to provide guidance for students as they navigate post-high school planning.\u00a0<\/span>However, the lack\u00a0of senior class advisories has created chaos and confusion during a critical time in students' high school careers. \u00a0While current seniors could still\u00a0benefit from an improved advisory system, it is imperative that Paly implement more college-oriented advisories for future senior classes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seniors applying to college expect guidance from their TAs, however, this is not possible if advisories aren\u2019t scheduled. \u00a0Although students are able to set up individual meetings with their advisors, mandatory advisories have to be implemented so all students are motivated to receive the critical information about the whole process.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College form deadlines that are set by Paly, such as those for the Cover sheet or the NACAC form, an application to receive financial aid, have\u00a0left seniors in a state of confusion. \u00a0Also, leading up to and on the due date of transcript orders, students served as peer advisors warning friends about the deadline; had an advisory been scheduled for the previous week, the chaos could have been avoided.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to TA coordinator Ann Deggelman, seniors have all the information they need to know about applications.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe set up the calendar so it\u2019s the same every year,\" Deggelman said. \u00a0\"At the end of junior [year] there are a lot of junior advisories preparing them for senior year and post college planning.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior year advisories do prepare students\u00a0well for upcoming events\u00a0and for taking standardized testing; however, seniors do not have all the information they need to know about applications during the actual process. Students also receive the Viking Guide at the beginning of their junior year. This guide is not very beneficial because there is a great amount of information in them that students are not able to navigate through without the guidance of advisors.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While beneficial to prepare students ahead of time, many misplace materials or forget essential information and deadlines over the summer. Additionally, the substantial amount of information given during junior year can be overwhelming and should be spread out over the course of senior year. \u00a0Seniors need to have advisory during the actual process so their TAs can guide them through the applications in real time\u00a0and remind them of deadlines or timelines they should be currently aware of.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While one of the last advisories for seniors did review early applications and financial aid for students, the meeting was held on Sept 1., two months before the actual application deadlines. \u00a0Many students did not retain all this information, nor did they carry it with them for over six weeks.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Andrea O\u2019Riordan believes that more advisories are necessary for seniors.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think the cover letter was briefly mentioned [last advisory] but other than that I don\u2019t remember much else that we did,\u201d O\u2019Riordan said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advisory system is meant to help students through the confusing times of college applications, but the insufficient advisory schedule makes seniors feel like Paly admin threw a great amount of information at them and then left them on their own through the actual college application process. \u00a0It was created with goals that include helping\u00a0students connect with their advisors as well as\u00a0reduce stress throughout their post-high school planning, but until more senior advisories are implemented with actual information about current timelines or deadlines, the system is not fulfilling its purpose. \u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"While current seniors could benefit from an improved advisory system, it is imperative that Paly implement more college oriented advisories for future seniors.","date":"2016-11-10 09:52:26","author":"Morgan Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/CCC-Photo.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["Advisory","college","college applications","early","new","Nov 1","opinion","revamp advisory","seniors","shortage","Stress"]},{"id":125652,"title":"Liveblog: 2016 elections results","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/08\/liveblog-2016-elections-results\/","content":"Voters across the United States will be selecting their future president along with an array of local and state politicians today.\r\n\r\nTune in to see The Paly Voice's liveblog of all local, state\u00a0and national elections.\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>11:33 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump will be the 45th president of the United States.\r\n\r\n<strong>9:56 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThanks for tuning in to The Paly Voice's liveblog!

Throughout American history, although there have been instances where electoral members have voted for someone other than who the public voted for, it has never changed the outcome of the election.\r\n\r\n<strong>9:02 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton's popular vote is at 47% to Trump's 48%.\r\n\r\nAs of now, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania are too close to call.

New Hampshire remains red.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:08 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAt this point, it looks like it will be very difficult for Democrats to capture the Senate.

Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin are all trending red. I think we may be seeing the Brexit effect in the United States.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:43 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWith 90 percent voting in Virginia, Trump is ahead by 16,000 votes.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:41 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf Trump wins the election, I will be very disappointed in many the polls that showed Clinton ahead.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:38 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton can afford to lose North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire and Arizona if she\u00a0holds her other firewall states.

The Morning Conduct carried out a <a href=\"https:\/\/morningconsult.com\/trump-clinton-unpopular\/\">survey<\/a>\u00a0asking voters who disapproved of the two candidates about the reasons for their views. To nobody's surprise, Clinton haters called her a liar, and 56 percent of voters think Trump is a racist. So why should anyone look up to either of these two as our president?\r\n\r\nWell, the answer lies in our country's roots. America has always been\u00a0a nation driven by compromise: it is what allows us to function and thrive as a country. Our unique ability to work together despite sometimes having starkly differing\u00a0opinions is imperative for finding middle ground on important issues and ultimately solving them.\r\n\r\nGenerally we live in a country where there is a division of power amongst the two major political parties. It is rare for Democrats or Republicans\u00a0to hold the White House as well as a majority in both houses of Congress, meaning that most\u00a0of American history has been\u00a0comprised of inter-party collaboration.\r\n\r\nWhen we sacrifice our willingness to cooperate we give up our power to solve problems and continue to move forward as a nation.\u00a0Part of what makes our political system\u00a0so special is that we don't quit.\u00a0Every four years\u00a0roughly\u00a0half the population is disappointed by the outcome of the presidential election, and that's just the nature of the system. However upsetting the result may be to some people, we all continue to work together\u00a0in the meantime, and the losers simply try again in four years.\r\n\r\nThe worst decision Americans can truly make is to fail to honor the sacred electoral system that holds our great nation together. These next four years will\u00a0be one the most consequential periods of modern American history, and we cannot look at issues like the war on terror and restoring the American economy with minds turned away from the idea of collaboration.\r\n\r\nWe could all spend the next four years complaining about how this November forced us to choose between the lesser of two evils, but where would that get us? I implore you, in an election season overrun by paranoia and hate, to see our next president as the leader of our nation, not the face of the party you didn't vote for.","excerpt":"Regardless of whether you're \"with her\" or if you want to \"make America great again,\" it is our duty as citizens of the United States to support our president, even if we have to grin and bear it.","date":"2016-11-07 22:01:50","author":"William Sallomi","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trump-and-Clinton.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["Clinton","Donald Trump","election 2016","Hillary Clinton","Politics","Trump","voting"]}]
