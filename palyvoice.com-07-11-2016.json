[{"id":125512,"title":"The education argument \u2014 why students should support Clinton","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/06\/the-education-argument-why-students-should-support-clinton\/","content":"In a presidential election torn between unpopular candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, many voters will be holding their noses as they vote or won\u2019t be voting at all. This is especially true for younger demographics, who have the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2016\/05\/16\/478237882\/millennials-now-rival-boomers-as-a-political-force-but-will-they-actually-vote\">lowest voter turnout rates<\/a> in the nation. While the candidates\u2019 policies have been largely overshadowed by political scandals and heated bickering, their views on primary and higher education will no doubt have lasting impacts on American students.\n\nClinton\u2019s education plans, while flawed, provide much greater benefits to students and most Americans as a whole. Trump\u2019s plans, on the other hand, will degrade the public school system and have limited effects on nearly all\u00a0college students.\n\nClinton is pursuing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hillaryclinton.com\/issues\/college\/\">bold and expensive plan <\/a>on making higher education more accessible. According to her website, her top priorities include making community college free, funding minority-majority colleges and assisting student parents. Most notably, she plans to make public colleges tuition free for families with incomes at or below $125,000 by 2021. On the topic of student debt, Clinton has proposed cracking down on predatory schools and lenders, cutting loan interest rates and offering a three-month moratorium on student loan payments to federal loan borrowers.\n\nClinton\u2019s plans will no doubt be an asset to lower-income families who cannot afford to send their children to college as well as to students buried in debt. Her plans have also earned her the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aft.org\/resolution\/endorsement-hillary-clinton\">endorsement<\/a> of the American Federation of Teachers union. By making college more accessible to all students, her plan will greatly increase the number of students completing some form of higher education.\n\nThe main problems with Clinton\u2019s plans are cost-related. According to the higher education writer and political analyst Kevin Carey, Clinton\u2019s original education plan, based on making community college free, was economically feasible. However, after adopting many of Bernie Sanders\u2019 policies,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/07\/20\/upshot\/the-trouble-with-hillary-clintons-free-tuition-plan.html\">her new plan became extremely expensive and would reward states that spend the least money on students.<\/a>\u00a0An increase in tax rates on the wealthy would likely be needed to fund her ambitious program.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has no specific plan on student debt or even college in general. His claim that the federal government shouldn\u2019t profit from student loans is a positive statement but far from the set\u00a0of policies that America needs. In September,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/articles\/life\/inside_higher_ed\/2016\/09\/what_is_donald_trump_s_plan_on_college_affordability.html\">he revealed his goal <\/a>of pressuring academic institutions with large endowments to spend more on students or lose their tax-exempt status. This would be a helpful action for some college students, but only for those who attend universities with multi-billion dollar endowments. Moreover, it is impossible to judge Trump\u2019s plan for college education because he doesn\u2019t even have one outside of the two simple statements outlined above.\n\nTrump\u2019s primary education plans are significantly better than his college education plans, but that isn't saying much. An enthusiastic proponent of \u201cschool choice,\u201d Trump believes that students should be able to attend any school they wish, public or private. This policy choice is interesting and could have the power to improve the educations of lower-income, minority students. However, it carries some significant flaws. Though Trump has touted such plans time and time again, he has never specifically stated how he will finance the $20 billion initiative. Given his opposition to raising taxes, the costs would likely either add to the federal debt or result in cuts to other parts of the current education budget.\n\nSchool choice also furthers the degradation of public schools by taking money away from the public school system. Furthermore,\u00a0because many private schools are religious, allowing\u00a0tax dollars to pay for private schools that subscribe to a particular faith is a blatant violation of the constitutional separation of church and state,\u00a0according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publicschoolreview.com\/blog\/the-ongoing-debate-over-school-choice\">Public School Review<\/a>.\n\nTrump\u2019s opposition to Common Core is a plus, as its standards are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernjournalism.com\/common-core-fundamental-flaws\/\">not based on sound research<\/a> and\u00a0have resulted in<a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernjournalism.com\/common-core-fundamental-flaws\/\"> lower test scores<\/a>, according to Western Journalism. However, the United States president has no power to repeal these standards, as they were adopted at a state level, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/ed\/2016\/09\/25\/494740056\/donald-trumps-plan-for-americas-schools\">NPR<\/a>. Furthermore, ending Common Core is not a magical solution to America\u2019s education problems. By basing nearly his entire education platform on denouncing these standards, Trump is ignoring issues plaguing American students that are not affected by the Common Core, such as nationwide achievement gaps and student debt.\n\nClinton\u2019s K-12 plans, on the other hand, are probably more expensive yet simultaneously more far-reaching. While Trump\u2019s school choice would push students to leave public schools, Clinton aims to go to the root of the problem by improving public schools themselves. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hillaryclinton.com\/briefing\/factsheets\/2016\/02\/18\/ending-the-school-to-prison-pipeline\/\">Her website outlines specific policies <\/a>on elevating the quality of teaching, investing in run-down schools and helping each student learn computer science. When compared to Trump\u2019s simple viewpoints on K-12, Clinton's plans help combat a broader range of education problems.\n\nUnfortunately, Clinton has never stated how she will finance these new plans, and given the billions of dollars she has pledged to invest in this area, it is unlikely that simply reprioritizing the current budget will allow her to pursue these policies. As a result, Clinton\u2019s extensive K-12 education plan will help students at the expense of higher taxes on the upper class\u2014a consequence that is arguably relatively minor as it\u00a0will likely affect few people.\n\nClinton\u2019s policies have their own expensive flaws, but they greatly outweigh Trump\u2019s college and K-12 education plans\u00a0as they actively attempt to limit student debt and address primary education problems ranging from run-down schools to teaching quality. In the end Americans will have the final say: By casting a vote, we will\u00a0choose either debt reduction and college accessibility or a bleak future for students.","excerpt":"Clinton\u2019s education plans, while flawed, provide much greater benefits to students and most Americans as a whole while Trump\u2019s plans will degrade the public school system and have limited effects on most college students.","date":"2016-11-06 20:34:17","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Screenshot-2016-11-06-at-4.01.42-PM.png","categories":["Election 2016","Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","Clinton","college","Community","donald","education","election","Hillary","K-12","Trump","University"]},{"id":125463,"title":"Football clinches spot in CCS with victory over Mountain View","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/06\/football-clinches-spot-in-ccs-with-victory-over-mountain-view\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Palo Alto High School football team (4-6, 3-3) is preparing for its first game in the Central Coast Section playoffs after it defeated the Mountain View Spartans (5-5, 2-4) on Friday night, earning the Vikings a spot in the playoffs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a tough loss to Los Gatos High School (7-3, 6-0) on Oct. 21, and a bye week, the Vikings bounced back and beat the Spartans.

Veenker stated that her top three priorities are securing the water supply, increasing education funding, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nVicki Veenker, a Palo Alto High School parent, well-respected attorney and member of the Silicon Valley Law Foundation, believes that her prior knowledge representing low-income individuals and uniform support from environmental leaders will lead to success in Sacramento, despite her lack of elected experience.\r\n\r\nShe is running for District 24 against Palo Alto City Council member Marc Berman to replace retiring assemblyman\u00a0Rich Gordon.\r\n\r\nAccording to Veenker, if elected, her top three priorities would be reducing greenhouse gases through aggressive petroleum and energy regulations, securing water supply through agriculture subsidy reductions and conservation and increasing education funding through commercial tax increases, income tax extensions and lower sentences for non-violent offenders.\r\n\r\n<strong>Education<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to improve consistently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/education\/article\/California-s-school-system-ranked-9th-worst-in-6410633.php\">low-ranked California education<\/a>, Veenker has a lofty multi-pronged approach.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we spend $8,000 per student, when the national average is around $11,000, that is embarrassing for a state like ours,\" Veenker said. \"We have to reduce class sizes by attracting good teachers and hiring and retaining them.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe is also in support of universal pre-kindergarten and STEM education and upholding\u00a0the role of charter schools, but with the need for more accountability and transparency.\r\n\r\nThese extensive education plans come at a huge cost, which has forced Veenker to propose\u00a0a number of tax raises. She wants Prop. 55 or the extension of income taxes (without the sales tax increase), a split role for property taxes where only commercial property taxes are raised and saving money through criminal justice reform.\r\n\r\nVeenker expressed concern about the achievement gap in schools and offers a slightly different approach than her opponent. She believes that although the local funding control formula is a good start \u2014 which\u00a0gives extra allocation of funds for English learners and low-income students \u2014 there needs to be a continued monitoring of the districts that receive that money.\r\n\r\nVeenker conveyed problems with University of California\u2019s reliance on out-of-state enrollment, partially stemming from her daughter\u2019s own experience. She wants to shift the share of educational costs from 30 percent covered by the state to 80 percent.\u00a0She did not, however, express a specific funding source for these goals.\r\n\r\n<strong>Criminal Justice<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLike her opponent Marc Berman, Veenker wants to see the death penalty repealed.\r\n\r\nVeenker has made the phrase \u201ceducation over incarceration\u201d a major plank of her campaign. On the issue of criminal justice reform, she supports \u201crealignment from jails and reducing the length of non-violent offenses.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe has supported marijuana legalization in the past, calling it \u201cinevitable,\" but believes in regulating it \u201cat least like alcohol or tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Veenker did not express any specific marijuana regulations she wants included, she did advocate for learning from other states along the way. She also\u00a0expressed great concern in how law enforcement assesses\u00a0sobriety, because technology does not currently exist to assess marijuana intoxication in real time. One of her main reasons for supporting legalization is to reduce jail sentences and to stop illegal marijuana farming in state parks.\r\n\r\n<b>Environment<\/b><strong>\u00a0and Climate Change<\/strong>\r\n\r\nVeenker has made climate change a major issue of her campaign and says her differentiating factor is her \u201cuniform support by environmental leaders for my campaign.\"\r\n\r\nShe is in support of requiring 50 percent of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030 and reducing petroleum use as well to cut greenhouse emissions by 50 percent by 2030. Veenker additionally wants to continue the landmark cap-and-trade program in California.\r\n\r\nVeenker said she she believes in both a residential and agricultural approach when addressing the water issue in California.\r\n\r\n\u201cConservation is great but I don\u2019t think that will get us all the way to where we want to go on this issue,\" Veenker said. \"We should decrease the subsidization of water prices to farmers, which they aren\u2019t going to like at the get-go.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt that we should \"subsidize their adoption of this sort of water-saving technology.\" Veenker also believed that California should channel money towards Silicon Valley to research innovative ways of saving water.\r\n\r\n<strong>Affordable Housing<\/strong>\r\n\r\nVeenker supports a more aggressive approach to affordable housing but has some reservations about some of the currently proposed models. She supports a state housing bonds and tax incentives to encourage affordable housing, a one-time spinoff of the budget surplus to fund housing projects and wants a more regional approach to housing. She did not support requiring where and how much a municipality has to build.\r\n\r\n<b>Infrastructure<\/b>\r\n\r\nGovernor Jerry Brown\u2019s high speed rail project has become a controversial issue as the costs have increased by 50 percent and obstacles have grown, according to The Economist. Veenker supports an extremely modified version of the high speed rail while her opponent is fully opposed to it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Veenker, her main concern is the increase in costs, which has pushed up estimates by 50 percent. Instead of connecting the high speed rail to San Francisco which she feels is futile, she wants to see it blended into the Caltrain at San Jose with a \u201ccommon platform.\u201d While not stating outright opposition to the high speed rail, she stated that she wants to see \u201ca new plan and appropriate oversight to make sure we do better this time in living into the plan.\u201d\r\n\r\nVeenker wants to use some of these high speed rail savings combined with bond measures and tax increases to help solve the Bay Area\u2019s gridlock.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a crisis in transportation right now, today, in the Bay Area and we have to get busy fixing that,\" Veenker said. \"We are starting to with the measures in Santa Clara County, the half cent sales tax, helping electrifying Caltrain and getting BART down the East Bay.\u201d\r\n\r\n<b>Follow the Money<\/b>\r\n\r\nCampaign finance has become a hot issue in Sacramento with various reform bills going in front of the assembly, the most notable being the DISCLOSE Act. According to the Secretary of Election\u2019s official site, Veenker has received the largest donations from the Silicon Valley Progressive Women for Equity and Oportunidad Supporting Vicki PAC (near $200,000). The <a href=\"http:\/\/opensecrets.org\/pacs\/pacfaq.php\">PAC<\/a> is comprised of $25,000 from both the Consumer Attorneys of California Independent Campaign Committee and the Commercial Workers Western States Council Independent Expenditure PAC.

According to Berman, his top three priorities are education, housing and infrastructure.

I think that universal preschool for all four-year olds is critically important, starting with low-income four-year olds. Expanding learning opportunities for youth from birth to three is going to be critical to closing the achievement gap.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berman also expressed concern for the lack of in-state students being accepted into the University of California system in recent years. He plans to focus on increasing the accessibility to the UC system for California students. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was talking to the chancellor of UC Santa Cruz about this,\u201d Berman said. \u201cAnd he said \u2018Let's take a wholesale review of the master plan for education, which promised accessibility to an affordable high quality education for California students who qualify.\u2019 We still have the high quality part but we don\u2019t have the affordable and accessible. We definitely need to revisit it.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With plans to create more educational opportunities for students, Berman recognized the need for additional funding. Despite not citing any specific parts he would address, he said he plans to reform the current tax structure to create more tax revenue.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think there\u00a0really needs to be a broader look at our tax structure as a whole to identify how much funding we want,\" Berman said. \"We need to\u00a0identify a tax structure that is as stable as possible so that every year we generate money as close to that as possible without the wild swings that we currently get.\"\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Campaign Finance<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaign finance has become an big issue in this campaign, as Berman's opponent, Veenker, and many others, including congresswoman Anna Eshoo, have voiced concerns over the amount of donation money Berman has received from special interest groups. Despite significant donation money\u00a0from a realtors group, Berman said that the enormous sum won\u2019t sway his policies and priorities, insisting that the group's major priorities align with his. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The three issues that the realtors really care about a lot, which align with mine, are education, housing, the need for smart growth, housing supply and infrastructure because the better the parks,\u00a0the better the community and the higher the house values are,\" Berman said. \"My platform just very well happens to align.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Affordable Housing<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To combat rising house prices, Berman hopes to involve the state in the funding process with an affordable housing bond to help non-profit organizations like Palo Alto Housing attempt to make housing more affordable.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"We need a statewide affordable housing bond,\" Berman said. \"They [Palo Alto Housing] need funding from numerous different sources including the state. Right now, San Mateo County and Santa Clara County have affordable housing bonds on the ballot. That is great, but the state needs to do likewise to really be a partner to solve our problem in affordable housing deficit.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berman also voiced his disapproval of rent control, a topic\u00a0supported by his opponent. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"A place where my opponent and I disagree is on rent control,\" Berman said. \"I don\u2019t support rent control and I definitely support increasing the supply of housing. I think that is what we need to do to stabilize rental rates and hopefully bring them down a little bit.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Infrastructure<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berman stressed the importance of improving California's infrastructure and promised to allocate resources to fix it. To raise the funds needed to undergo such projects, Berman cited multiple proposed taxes, including one on electric vehicle owners.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Sen. Jim Bell, who is a state\u00a0senator for San Jose and surrounding areas, has put forth a short-term proposal that gets funding from a variety of different methods,\" Berman said. \"One is increasing the gas tax which hasn\u2019t been increased in a couple of decades and another is increasing the vehicle license and registration fees a small amount. Also, I believe having a fee of 100 dollars a year for EV owners is totally viable and reasonable to help collect money. Long-term, I believe we need to have a vehicle miles traveled system to help get taxes to repair\u00a0our roads. It will take some upfront money, but it will save us money if we get our roads up to high quality.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nBerman additionally\u00a0supported a split role tax plan to prevent property taxes from rising while still bringing in tax revenue from commercial property.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I support a split role, which would be having commercial property, assessed on a more regular basis and not changing it for regular property, because that would have a detrimental effect on a lot of seniors on fixed incomes,\" Berman said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Bullet Train<\/b>\r\n\r\nBerman also discussed his concerns with Gov. Jerry Brown's\u00a0current plan to build a bullet train for transport from Los Angeles to San Francisco and expressed a desire to focus on local transportation first.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t support the bullet train as it is right now because I think we need to address our regional transportation problems,\" Berman said. \"In 12, 14, 16 or 18 years from now, I believe that we will have better technology to get us from San Francisco to Los Angeles and so I think we have to focus on helping people get from Alameda to Palo Alto.\u201d\r\n\r\n<b>Death Penalty<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berman expressed a desire to\u00a0move towards incarceration and away from the death penalty, citing issues such as mistakes, cost and length of time. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt [the death penalty] takes a long time, it is expensive and I think that life without the possibility of parole is a legitimate punishment for people who have done terrible crimes,\u201d Berman said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Marijuana Legalization<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berman is in favor of marijuana legalization, as he hopes that being able to regulate it can lead to more tax revenue and fewer sales to younger demographics. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI do support the legalization of marijuana because I think we are better off regulating it, taxing it and enforcing it,\" Berman said. \"Let\u2019s legalize it so that we make sure only people who are 21 and older can purchase it in a well-regulated climate.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Water Supply<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water conservation has become a hot topic in California with the prolonged drought. Berman said that he believes\u00a0rainwater needs to be caught and used more effectively\u00a0and more technology needs to be used to efficiently use water in farming\u00a0to grow crops. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berman believes that his vast experiences, including serving as\u00a0a Palo Alto City Council member, has set him up perfectly to represent the 24th District. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I think it\u2019s the breadth of experience that I have across all three sectors that really prepares me to step in on day one and be an effective member for the 24th assembly district and for all of California,\" Berman said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nTo learn more about his opponent, Vicki Veenker, click <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.io\/v\/125336\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Marc Berman, an attorney by training and current Palo Alto City Council member, plans to use his breadth of political experience to represent the 24th District if elected to the State Assembly on Nov. 8.","date":"2016-11-05 14:33:57","author":"Chirag Akella","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/14971164_888089307994598_371845627_n.jpeg","categories":["Features"],"tags":["24th District","berman","election","state assembly","veenker"]},{"id":125385,"title":"Admin alters GPA weighting action","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/04\/school-board-alters-gpa-weighting-action\/","content":"Palo Alto High School will not \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 be sending weighted grade point average\u2019s to schools who\u00a0seniors have submitted early applications, contrary to the Board of Education\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/02\/board-votes-for-weighted-on-mid-year-transcripts-for-class-of-2017\/\">ruling on Tuesday<\/a> and the announcement given to seniors during Advisory on Thursday, according to a statement released by Principal Kim Diorio during 5th period on Schoology.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Diorio\u2019s statement, this change has come because of newly found, unspecified data that shows how many Paly students\u2019 GPAs will decrease\u00a0when weighted with the UC system compared to their unweighted GPAs.

While administrators at both Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School have spoken in favor of adopting Supt. Max McGee\u2019s proposed district-wide policy of reporting unweighted GPAs only, many students and parents have vehemently argued against it, on the grounds that such a policy disadvantages students for certain merit scholarships and represents an infringement on student freedom.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tuesday night, the Board of Education <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/02\/board-votes-for-weighted-on-mid-year-transcripts-for-class-of-2017\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">passed a motion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to change the GPA reporting practice for the Class of 2017 at both Paly and Gunn - seniors who are currently in the midst of the college application process. For the mid-year report that will be sent to colleges, both the unweighted and weighted GPAs will be recorded on transcripts.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first glance, this may seem like a simple solution; reporting weighted GPAs eliminates any risk, however infinitesimal it may be, of a student being disadvantaged for scholarships. Additionally, weighted GPAs will emphasize the AP and honor classes that students take and supposedly give them the appropriate credit for challenging coursework. But what is ostensibly a straightforward solution will in reality open up a Pandora\u2019s box of other issues, and we urge community members to critically consider the long term repercussions.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Considering the consequences<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin, the practice of reporting weighted GPAs will almost certainly reinforce the excessively competitive academic culture that has become associated with Palo Alto. Weighting GPAs will encourage people to take AP- and honors-heavy course loads, at the expense of regular lane and\/or elective classes. Furthermore, since Paly and Gunn offer far more weighted STEM classes than humanities and social science classes, the practice of reporting weighted GPAs in effect diminishes the value of non-STEM courses. And alarmingly, reporting weighted GPAs is just a step away from ranking students, either formally or in a de facto manner, because weighted GPAs make it far easier to delineate between students\u2019 GPAs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The programs that board members have touted as examples of educational innovation, such as Advanced Authentic Research, the Social Justice Pathway and the journalism program, as well as performing and visual arts classes, will likely see declining enrollment as a result of the GPA decision. When forced to compete with peers and choose between programs that will add to their overall high school experience or boost their GPA, many will choose the latter.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the recording of weighted GPAs on transcripts could exacerbate another dogged problem in our district: the achievement gap. Only relatively wealthy students will be able to afford the outside tutoring for honors and AP courses, or off-campus instruction that allows them to accumulate more weighted credit, creating an even larger chasm between the privileged and the underserved in our community.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concern about the practice of weighting GPAs harming our most vulnerable students isn\u2019t a hypothetical one; it is very much grounded in anecdotal evidence. Because most weighted GPA methodologies do not take into account classes such as Living Skills and Physical Education, students who have earned high grades in those courses but have struggled in academic core classes may have lower weighted GPAs than unweighted GPAs. At the board meeting on Tuesday night, Paly Principal Kim Diorio reported that the administration has identified approximately 50 Paly students for whom this is the case. These students are disproportionately ethnic minorities, come from low-income families and have Individualized Education Programs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weighted GPAs also present a whole host of logistical issues and unnecessary confusion. For the updated reports that will be sent out to all schools students have applied to early, in addition to the mid-year reports that will be sent out for the Class of 2017, Paly will adopt the UC\/CSU methodology to calculate students' GPAs, while Gunn will be sticking with the algorithm it has been using for the past several years. Though board members claimed they prioritized standardizing practices between the two schools, their proposal doesn\u2019t even address the problem: there is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a disparity between Paly and Gunn. And if the schools were to continue weighting students\u2019 grades, what weighting methodology would they employ? Would they use the UC system, which doesn\u2019t consider many underclassmen honors classes for weighted credit and caps students to a maximum of eight semesters of weighted courses? Or would they devise another methodology, that would ultimately be arbitrary because colleges recalculate GPAs on their own? This is just a small sampling of the never-ending stream of questions that would arise.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Dispelling fictions<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though we are concerned about the effects of this decision on our school climate, we would like to emphasize that current seniors should not be concerned about the change in GPA reporting practices affecting their chances for college applications.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College admissions officers across the nation will unequivocally say that your transcript is considered within the context of your high school, and obviously, a Paly student\u2019s unweighted GPA is not being compared, from a purely numerical standpoint, with another applicant\u2019s weighted GPA. At the most recent school board meeting, proponents of weighted GPAs presented evidence that seemed to show that students with weighted GPAs receive a boost in college admissions. But those sources are misleading, because information was selectively cherry-picked. And significantly, our college counseling professionals and various admissions officers have told us the complete opposite: they state that high schools' GPA reporting practices do not have bearing on students' chances for acceptance.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addresses to the school board, some people have mentioned the scholarship opportunities that students will be deprived of if the district does not report weighted GPAs. We strongly believe that the district should do everything in its capacity to help students procure financial aid. However, it is nonsensical to use merit scholarships as a justification for changing the GPA practice because administrators have yet to find a college that will not accept a letter vouching for a student's weighted GPA in place of it on a transcript. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of a Paly student missing the GPA cutoff for a merit scholarship at the University of Oregon because her unweighted GPA was reported, Kim Diorio contacted an admissions officer at Oregon and resolved the issue; the student is now eligible to receive the scholarship. According to Diorio, the admissions representative did not want Paly to change its GPA reporting policy for one student, and as such, Oregon has agreed to accept letters from Paly and Gunn administrators vouching for weighted GPAs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, many in the pro-weighted GPA camp have said that reporting unweighted GPAs de-incentivizes students from challenging themselves academically. But this cannot be true, because many people at Paly and in general have taken difficult class loads knowing full well that only their unweighted GPAs will be reported to colleges. What reporting weighted GPAs could do, however, is compel students who aren\u2019t prepared for or interested in the content of AP classes to take them, and further contribute to a hyper-competitive academic atmosphere.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Moving forward<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The choice to report weighted GPAs is a drastic one, and likely irrevocable; we believe it will be near impossible to revert to the old system if the district elects to formally adopt reporting weighted GPAs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most appalling part about this decision is that students and parents were assured in writing that nothing would change for this college admissions cycle, and the school board, in unanimously voting to put weighted GPAs on our transcripts, has completely walked back on that promise. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A letter sent out to parents by the Parent Teacher Student Association on Oct. 13 stated, \u201cAs parents, we ask that you please share with your teen that for this school year, nothing will change. Anything about the issue will not affect the Class of 2017.\u201d Supt. McGee expressed similar sentiments in his weekly message published on Oct. 28, stating \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this year we are not recommending changing the current practices for grade reporting at either Gunn or Paly.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suffice to say, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">w<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e are deeply disappointed with the board members \u2014 who have run on platforms of promoting student wellbeing \u2014 for ignoring the recommendations of professional educators and proceeding with a motion that has the potential to increase stress among the student body. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The extremely abrupt school board decision also failed to follow previously established norms of evaluating both sides of the issue prior to making tangible changes. In the past, PAUSD has spent months forming committees, fostering discussion and reviewing board reports when making a decision affecting students. It is shocking that the board did not follow the same procedure in considering the GPA issue \u2014 what should have been a thoughtful and comprehensive evidence-gathering process became a rushed political maneuver to satiate the demands of an aggressive lobby.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while this hasty short-term proposal has been agreed on for this year's senior class, it is not too late for the district to reevaluate this decision and thoroughly examine the consequences that this will have on the culture of Palo Alto high schools for years to come.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve worked so hard, for so long, to fundamentally address the issue of student stress across Palo Alto schools. We take great pride in our community but far too many of us have felt the effects of a suffocatingly competitive environment\u00a0that overemphasizes academic achievement and contributes to a reduced sense of self-worth.\u00a0The practice of r<\/span>eporting weighted GPAs\u00a0is a multifaceted issue that has the potential to affect our school culture \u2014 and it certainly deserves\u00a0more than the cursory consideration it received.\r\n\r\n<i>Editor's Note: To avoid a conflict of interest with his involvement in this issue, The Paly Voice's adviser disengaged himself from the writing of this editorial.

Max McGee\u00a0makes preliminary recommendations before allowing community input on the topic of weighted GPAs.

Paly Principal Kim Diorio clearly supports only including unweighted GPAs, but forced to choose, she recommended including the UC-weighted GPA.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Diorio also said that she knows that at least 50 students will be negatively affected by this decision. Those students, according to Diorio, tend to be low-income, historically underrepresented, and students with Individual Education Programs.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The decision came less than an hour before the Early Decision deadline for college applications, effectively changing how students are assessed for all high school classes\u00a0they have already completed.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last night's debate revolved mainly around the issue of reporting weighted versus unweighted GPAs on transcripts for students.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This topic recently arose due to a Palo Alto High School senior\u00a0voicing concerns about the disparities between how Gunn High School and Paly\u00a0report GPAs.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The student, Maya Katz, asserted that because Paly does not currently report weighted GPAs, she is disadvantaged for certain merit scholarships that consider GPA as the primary criteria, most notably scholarships at the University of Oregon. The current practice at Paly is that, if a student would benefit in the scholarship consideration process from having his or her weighted GPA reported, the Guidance Office\u00a0will contact the specific universities and vouch for the student's weighted GPA.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The board essentially overruled a more tempered proposal from Supt. Max McGee that called for a committee to explore the implications of a weighted GPA.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125291\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"323\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/DSC_0023.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-125291\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/DSC_0023.jpg\" alt=\"Palo Alto High School senior Maya Katz speaks out in support of having a weighted GPA reported on transcripts.
