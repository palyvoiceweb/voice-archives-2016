This year, we have a group of guys that have been playing together for years and a fresh new group of underclassmen.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of the departed seniors included the team's goalkeeper, Eli Friedlander, leaving a large hole in the Vikings' defensive roster.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith no clear starting goalie at this point, there are a couple a good options ... but we have yet to see them in games, and it's hard to replace someone like [last year\u2019s goalie],\u201d senior team captain Neil Verwillow said.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Vikings have gained many new seniors,\u00a0 who were inspired to join as it dawned on them this was their last year to play for\u00a0Paly, according to Verwillow. Four seniors as well as five juniors and sophomores will be joining this year's roster.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"_5yl5\">\"I had played for my club team the last three years during the winter, but I decided to play [high school] soccer with my friends in my last year,\" senior Nicholas Camarena said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe guys coming out are very good, so if anything, I believe we have the potential to be even more competitive than last year despite the loss,\u201d Verwillow said.\r\n\r\nVerwillow is excited for another shot at the CCS championship, and encourages student to attend the games.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a blast when people come out to the games and it makes us all play that much harder,\u201d Verwillow said. \u201cI also can't wait for another chance at CCS, no matter what it takes to get there.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeyond doing well in CCS, the team also has goals to develop stronger team bonds.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn past years we've had great groups of individual players, but never really a strong holistic team,\u201d Schoenberger said. \u201cThis year one thing [that] seniors are trying to change is the attitude that is carried throughout the year of not only playing lights out during games, but during practices too.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings played their first preseason game on Nov. 21 against Mountain View, winning 3-0.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we played pretty well ... there is definitely lots of room for improvement,\u201d junior Xander Sherer said. \u201cI think it was a good opportunity for some of the new players to get a feel for varsity game play.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team also recently went against Milpitas High School on Nov. 29, winning, 9-0, as well as defeating Carlmont High School, 2-1, on Nov. 30.\r\n\r\nThe team's next preseason game will be at 3:30 p.m. today at home against Menlo-Atherton High School.

These rigorous matches served as solid preparation for the season ahead and were ultimately crucial in helping the girls acclimate to the new roster.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior outside hitter Denise\u00a0Ringwalt, once the season officially began, the girls began to better combine their talents and work together.\r\n\r\n\"I think the team this year was filled with extremely talented girls that worked together better and better as the season went on,\" Ringwalt said.\r\n\r\nOnly the Los Altos High School Eagles (22-15, 7-5), out of all of the teams in the De Anza League, were able to defeat\u00a0the Vikings, who finished the league with a remarkable\u00a0record of 11-1.\r\n\r\nThe season had several high points, including a nail-biting match against the Eagles in which the Vikings won each set 25-22, and shattered a three-year losing streak to the Eagles.\r\n\r\nDespite having an excellent season, Los Gatos High School Wildcats (20-16, 7-5)\u00a0overpowered the Vikings in the Central Coast Section\u00a0championship match.\u00a0According to Ringwalt, the loss was unexpected and unfortunate for the hard working Vikings, and the injury of junior outside hitter Chelsea Fan was a key factor in the\u00a0defeat.\r\n\r\n\"The CCS championships was a really difficult loss,\" Ringwalt said.\u00a0\"The team worked really hard, but when Chelsea got hurt, everyone kinda fell apart.\"\r\n\r\nFan said despite not making it as far as she had hoped, she is proud of the team and what it accomplished this season.\r\n\r\n\"A couple injuries toward the end made it [the season] end a little sooner than it truly should have, but overall I'm happy with how far we went this year compared to previous seasons,\" Fan said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings must say goodbye to many talented seniors, including\u00a0setters\u00a0Cassie Fong and Jessica Lee, and outside hitters Fiona Green and Katie Passarello. Fan said the seniors performed well throughout the year and will be tough to replace.\r\n\r\n\"The seniors were a huge part of our team this year and they contributed a lot on the court,\" Fan said. \"Next year we'll definitely have trouble filling their spots.\"\r\n\r\nThe team as a whole\u00a0displayed excellent chemistry on and off the court, which was a significant strength and advantage.\u00a0According to Fan, returning Paly players built upon chemistry that they formed during the previous year.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of girls who started this year played together last season so our on-court team chemistry was great,\" Fan said.\r\n\r\nThis chemistry will play a role in the strength of the Vikings next season, who will take their experience this year and continue to\u00a0work to create another high-level team.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School volleyball team is celebrating  an impressive overall record of 23-11 and a successful season, which ended after a loss to the Turlock High School Bull Dogs (28-12, 10-2) in the first round of the States competition.","date":"2016-12-04 20:56:31","author":"William Sallomi","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/VB-VS-Gunn.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["CCS","Chelsea Fan","deedee ringwalt","season recap","sports","volleyball"]},{"id":126695,"title":"Verbatim: What&#8217;d you do over the Thanksgiving break?","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/04\/verbatim-whatd-you-do-over-the-thanksgiving-break\/","content":"Last week, Palo Alto High School students and faculty enjoyed a break from school for the Thanksgiving holiday.

We are definitely looking to win [CCS] this year.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to senior defender Lauola Amanoni, the loss of last year\u2019s seniors Jacey Pederson, Heidi Moeser and Allison Lu will greatly affect the leadership of the team, but this year\u2019s returning upperclassmen are prepared to fill those roles.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [Pederson, Moeser, and Lu] were a huge part of our success last year and we\u2019ll definitely miss them but we have many players such as Tess [Preising], Talia [Malchin], and Emily [Tomz] who are ready to take over with leadership,\u201dAmanoni said.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the team will be just as competitive as last season due to the addition of talented underclassmen, according to Preising.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe lost some good talent but we have many new players that can fill their spots,\u201d Preising said. \u201c[freshman forward] Chloe Japi\u0107 is someone to definitely watch for.\u201d\r\n\r\nPreising said the team's biggest weakness is its lack of chemistry due to new players.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the weakness right now is that we are all not very comfortable with each other on the field and don\u2019t know each other's strengths or weaknesses yet,\u201d Preising said. \u201cHopefully through more practice, we will get better and more cohesive in our play.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will take on rivals, Menlo-Atherton High School, at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday at Paly.","excerpt":"After a riveting, 3-2, loss to Mountain View High School in the Central Coast Section championship match last season, the Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 soccer team hopes to make another playoff run despite the loss of key seniors.","date":"2016-12-02 09:42:54","author":"Ethan Kao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/GIRLS-SOCCER-Season-recap.png","categories":["Sports","Spotlight","Uncategorized"],"tags":["almost","amazing","but","cccs","CCS","finals","football","girls","great","jacey pederson","mountain view","no","Soccer","tess","won"]},{"id":126517,"title":"&#8216;Loving&#8217;: What&#8217;s not to love?","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/01\/loving-whats-not-to-love\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_126666\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"430\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/1475626768_focusfeatures_loving_jeffnichols_joeledgerton_ruthnegga_voteloving_instagram1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-126666\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/1475626768_focusfeatures_loving_jeffnichols_joeledgerton_ruthnegga_voteloving_instagram1.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton star in the latest historical film 'Loving'. Photo: Focus Features\" width=\"430\" height=\"430\" \/><\/a> Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton star in the latest historical film 'Loving'. Photo: Focus Features[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDid you know that interracial marriage wasn\u2019t always legal in the United States? In the non-fiction, historical-drama film , 'Loving,' directed by Jeff Nichols, the audience follows two main characters \u2014 a black woman, Mildred, and a white man, Richard \u2014 who fall in love and want to get married despite obstacles; however, it\u2019s not that simple.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both lived most of their lives in the small town of Central Point, Virginia, which takes place in the late 1960's, where interracial marriage was illegal at the time, and one was only allowed to marry someone of his or her own race. The movie is told through Mildred and Richard\u2019s eyes. While they are living in Virginia, police arrest them in their own home, in the middle of the night, for breaking the anti-miscegenation laws of their state. They move to the nation\u2019s capital, Washington, D.C., to get married and to raise their three children. Little did they know that during this time, with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, their experience with the law would be a gateway to make a change for equality.<\/span>\r\n\r\nBoth Joel Edgarton and Ruth Negga do a satisfying job in their roles as Richard and Mildred. They have good chemistry on emotional scenes, such as, powerful expressions on their faces so the audience would figure out what they were feeling, some could see them working together in the future. Bernie Cohen, played by Nick Kroll, is the lawer who picks up this case. This character plays as comic relief because he is an ackward person as a result of the words he uses and his posture on scene, which is what Nichols is going for. His partner Phill Bass, played by Jon Bass, is the more serious lawer that keeps him in check. Both of these characters do a good job of creating suspense in the film.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the story unfolds, the audience can't help but side with and cheer on the couple because of the connection they have and everything they have been through. Some people at the time got harassed for being in a multi-racial relationship; they were judged by peers and loved ones. The love that Mildred and Richard share for each other and the conflicted emotions that others have toward them make it clear that this story is going to pull at some heartstrings.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Movie's cinematographer Adam Stone, portrays police in the movie as villains who will do anything to get the protagonists in jail. Stone uses dark lighting and body language well with these characters, highlighting the use of their aggressive nature and atmosphere that is apparent. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, throughout the movie it was hard to understand the dialogue between characters because of their accents and soft voices, which some could argue made the movie more realistic, but at times made the conversations harder to understand.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the movie continues, you feel the injustice of these laws. The government is dictating who people are allowed to love and marry. Mildred and Richard are everyday people who weren\u2019t looking for fame or publicity but rather just wanted what most of us desire, a person to love and be with forever and a chance at happiness. This movie is a must see for those looking for good character development, an authentic snapshot of that time and an emotionally uplifting story that will put you in the shoes of the people who fought against the law.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Loving<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rating: PG-13<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Run time: 123 minutes <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Director: Jeff Nichols<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<b>Actors\/Actresses: Joel Edgerton as Richard, Ruth Negga as Mildred, \u00a0Michael Shannon as Grey Villet, Nick Kroll as Bernie Cohen, Marton Csokas as Sheriff Brooks, Alano Miller as Raymond Green, and Jon Bass as Phil Bass<\/b>","excerpt":"Did you know that interracial marriage wasn\u2019t always legal in the United States?
