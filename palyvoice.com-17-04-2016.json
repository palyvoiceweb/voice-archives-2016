Each panel is designed to convey a different aspect of Paly, including \u201cWe are creative,\u201d \u201cWe have spirit,\u201d \u201cWe struggle\u201d and \u201cWe learn.\u201d\r\n\r\nArtists working on the mural hope that it will allow students to reflect on their own lives at Paly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe [the students] wanted to create a mural that embodies the entire spirit of Paly,\u201d says junior Grace Zhao, who d<span class=\"_5yl5\">esigned the Spirit Week scene in the bottom left corner<\/span>. \u201cThe mural does not just depict the happy aspects of Paly, but everything about it. We wanted to have an accurate depiction of the student life at Paly.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKenzie echoes these sentiments, stating that this mural's primary purpose is to bring something different to the community.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have had a really tough last couple of years, emotionally, and people from outside have wanted to come on campus to do art,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cIt felt like it was a really good time now to have students do art. It is like there is this call throughout the campus for art that was healing and uplifting and reflective of our lives.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to McKenzie, the current plan is to have at least half the mural completed by the end of this school year.\r\n\r\nZhao says that the artists are in no rush to complete the mural, as the painting is still a learning process. Painters will work in groups that rotate on different days, thereby allowing participants to work on the mural and still cover class material.\r\n\r\nMcKenzie hopes that this mural will spark a conversation about art on campus.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe reason why we are doing this is because the James Franco mural made people talk about art on campus,\" McKenzie said. \"One of the things that the art department is trying to do is to get more artistic experiences, whether it\u2019s art or music out on campus.\"\r\n\r\nAdministrators also want this mural to exhibit the works of Paly's art community.\r\n\r\n\"I think that the mural will display the talented artists that go to school here,\" Assistant Principal of Operations Jerry Berkson said. \"We really just want to show off our talented artists.\"\r\n\r\nArtists are excited to be working on the mural, as they believe they are adding their piece to the Paly legacy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that being able to paint the mural is really cool because it is a student-designed and created mural,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cI feel like it is something that was worth doing, and worth committing time to, as I am helping my school.\u201d","excerpt":"Students in the Advanced Drawing and Painting class are painting a mural on the wall of the Student Activities Center at Palo Alto High School after a James Franco mural was removed early this year.","date":"2016-04-15 16:04:15","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/IMG_0313.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Advanced Drawing and Painting Class","art","grace zhao","james franco","jerry berkson","Kate McKenzie","mural","Student Activities Center"]},{"id":119019,"title":"Liveblog: Baseball faces off against Los Gatos","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/15\/liveblog-baseball-faces-off-against-los-gatos\/","content":"Check back in at 4p.m. as the Palo Alto High School baseball team (13-2-1, 8-1) looks to maintain their first place position against the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (11-8, 7-1) at 4 p.m. Friday at home.

Last year the topic was rebuilding cities struck with a natural disaster using renewable energy.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe problem-solving portion involves both a build event and a set of questions related to eight topics, according to Hong.\u00a0The eight topics are pumping systems, failure engineering and materials science, genomics, lenses and telescopes, microscope technology, semiconductor materials, six sigma manufacturing methods and space exploration.\r\n\r\nThe club hopes to retain its previous rankings and improve its ranking in the problem solving portion, according to junior co-president Samarth Venkatasubramaniam.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast year, we got second in essay, sixth in presentation and seventh overall,\u201d Venkatasubramaniam\u00a0said. \u201cIn the upcoming months, we'll be writing our essay and then we will research and practice for the other two events.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the club is only in its second year, Hong says he believes it will continue to grow and members will gain valuable experience competing in competitions with real-world topics.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">\u201cHopefully the introduction of a club like this will allow even more students to explore STEM [Science Technology Engineering and Math] and investigate topics that aren't taught in a typical science class,\u201d Hong said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe national competition will take place from June 28 to July 2 in Nashville, Tennessee.","excerpt":"Three teams of Palo Alto High School students are preparing to attend the nationals competition this summer after placing at the TEAMS (Test of Engineering Aptitude in Math and Science) state competition on Feb. 27.\r\n","date":"2016-04-14 11:13:00","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/teams-pic.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["competition","daniel","hong","Jerry","nationals","palo alto high school","paly","samarth","states","stem","teams","venkatasubramaniam","zahra"]},{"id":118817,"title":"ASB announces majority of team for 2016-17 school year","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/13\/asb-announces-majority-of-team-for-2016-17-school-year\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_118953\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"620\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/12312469_481970981983406_483221451_n1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-118953\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/12312469_481970981983406_483221451_n1.jpg\" alt=\"Paly's ASB poses for a photo during a meeting.

These two will be accompanied by ASB secretary junior Kevin Chen. The treasurer position remains unfilled, along with the junior vice president position. These positions will be filled in a <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.io\/v\/118740\">special election<\/a> this Thursday and Friday.\r\n\r\nNagar said she believes the ASB president is a very influential position within the student government, and that it is key for\u00a0the president to make sure everyone has their voice heard.\r\n\r\n\"The ASB president is someone who empowers everyone in ASB to be their best,\" Nagar said. \"I think it's very important that the ASB president makes the ASB class somewhere people can brainstorm, plan, and execute their ideas, as well as receive input from the student body.\"\r\n\r\nNagar's counterpart, Lathi, is excited for the opportunity to bridge the gap between different grades, and strengthen the bonds between ASB and club officers. Lathi is also looking to reach out to the incoming freshman and help ensure a smooth transition into high school.\r\n\r\n\"Being vice president means that I\u00a0will be responsible chiefly for the connection between ASB and club officers, though I would also like to promote stronger bonds between students of different grades,\" Lathi said. \"I also hope to reach incoming freshmen, and garner their interest in participating in clubs prior to the first Club Day.\"\r\n\r\nChen believes that he will be playing a smaller role in ASB, but hopes to contribute as much as possible to group discussions.\r\n\r\n\"I don't really have an agenda or plans, but I hope to listen to to the ideas and give my two cents into the discussion,\" Chen said. \"Since this is my first year having an ASB position I do not have any big goals.\"\r\n\r\nThe full list of newly elected ASB and class officers can be viewed below.\r\n\r\nASB President: Anmol Nagar\r\nASB Vice President: Maya Lathi\r\nASB Treasurer: (unfilled)\r\nASB Secretary: Kevin Chen\r\n\r\nSenior President: Noa Ben-Efraim\r\nSenior Vice President: Natalie Maloney\r\n\r\nJunior President: Jaiveer Sandhu\r\nJunior Vice President: (unfilled)\r\n\r\nSophomore President: Caroline Furrier\r\nSophomore Vice President: Shannon Zhao","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body has announced the winners of the 2016-2017 election for ASB and class officer positions.","date":"2016-04-13 18:27:57","author":"Noah Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12312469_481970981983406_483221451_n.jpg","categories":["ASB Election 2016","News"],"tags":["ASB","ben-efraim","Chen","election","Furrier","junior","Lathi","maloney","nagar","officer","President","sandhu","secretary","senior","sophomore","treasurer","vice president","winners","Zhao"]}]
