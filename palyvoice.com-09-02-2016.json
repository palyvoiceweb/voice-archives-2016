Photo by William Zhou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to streamline research, the Palo Alto High School Library recently purchased\u00a0its new<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paly.net\/academics\/library\">\u00a0One Search Discovery Tool<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like the name suggests, One Search Discovery aims to simply research by aggregating the library's various research tools into one page, according to Paly librarian Rachel Kellerman.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne Search Discovery is a global search engine that connects most of the library\u2019s research products,\u201d Kellerman said. \"As consumers we don\u2019t want to click a lot, everyone wants products where you can get to the meat of the product as fast as possible.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, the librarians are working on introducing students to One Search Discovery. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe challenge is always marketing,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cI\u2019m working on an online tutorial, and librarian Sima Thomas went into all the AP Psychology classes to demo the tool. My goal is to go into all the social science courses so that every senior touches this product before he or she leaves.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through their tutorials and visits, the librarians hope to familiarize students with One Search Discovery's many features, according to Kellerman. <\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cIn addition to searching, you can also filter specifically for books in the library, e-books and books published within a certain date range,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIf you are at home, you can also access the database through the library libguide. The nice thing about the e-books is that you can search for specific words in the books and the e-books aren't one to one, so the whole class could be looking at the same book. Furthermore, you can create folders, save books and access them anywhere, it\u2019s very much like a Google Drive environment.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the school's contract with its previous research tool expired, the librarians had been looking for a new system that could make research faster. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe old system for searching was very, very slow,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIf you needed a book, you would have to go to the library catalog, then if you wanted a database article you would have to go the library libguide, then if you wanted an e-book you would have to go the e-book catalog. Nothing was integrated. The old library system that we had was\u00a0more designed for middle school students.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the librarians hope that this new tool will help prepare students for college research.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSimilar search tools to One Search Discovery are found in colleges and universities,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to use, but like a new app on your phone it's good to practice before you have pressure for a research report and we wanted to expose students to it beforehand.\u201d \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Kellerman, the adoption of the One Search Discovery tool is representative of Paly\u2019s willingness to innovate and explore. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe're one of the high school that vendors [of software] will look at because we will try things out,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIn the spring we\u2019re going to a user's conference day that mostly has colleges, but we\u2019ve been invited because Paly really has that forward looking attitude.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the librarians discovered One Search Discovery last year, it has taken around nine months to get it up and running and they\u2019re still some areas which need to be improved. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou still need to click through a couple pages to access the text for the e-book,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cAnd some research tools like The New York Times and ABC Cleo aren\u2019t integrated.\u201d \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student reaction has been positive so far,\u00a0according to Kellerman. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe best reactions I got were \u2018I found it!\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m going to use it.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Alice On\u2019s opinion reflects Kellerman\u2019s view. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d On said. \u201cI tried it in my AP Psych class and there were some glitches, but other than that, it\u2019s pretty cool and convenient. It\u2019s like the entire library on your computer, I think I\u2019ll use it in the future.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Library recently launched its One Search Discovery Tool in an effort to streamline research.","date":"2016-02-08 11:48:23","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/photo.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["faster","Kellerman","one search discovery","paly","research","streamline"]},{"id":115917,"title":"18 senior athletes commit to schools on National Signing Day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/08\/18-senior-athletes-commit-to-schools-on-national-signing-day\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115919\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/DSC_0026.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-115919\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/DSC_0026.jpg\" alt=\"Seniors Katie Francis and Andrew Cho sign their college athletic letters of intent on Wednesday in the Media Arts Center.

It\u2019s one that not many kids get to experience.\u201d\r\n\r\nLiang credited Paly for preparing students, academically and otherwise, and offered some helpful advice to the college-bound athletes.\r\n\r\n\u201cPaly has prepared you extremely well for this [being a college athlete],\u201d Liang said. \u201cYou should continue to use the skills you have learned over these your four years and apply them in college. There will be ups and downs, just like there were in your four years here.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Givens, who will be playing Division 1 football at Southern Utah University, this day served as an affirmation to his dedication to athletics throughout high school.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have worked so hard for this,\u201d Givens said. \u201cFrom coming to school at 7 a.m, to just working out to get bigger and stronger, to giving it 110% during practice. Even if I didn\u2019t get an offer, I know that I worked hard enough to get one. This is an amazing feeling and I\u2019m really glad that this happened to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nNot all of the Vikings who signed to a college will be competing in Division I athletics. Kayleigh Svensson, who will be attending Wellesley College for Division III swimming, is looking forward to the experience, but does not want it to dominate her academic career.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just focusing a little bit more on school, but I\u2019m still very, very excited to swim,\u201d Svensson said. \u201cIt should be a fun four years.\u201d","excerpt":"Eighteen Palo Alto High School senior athletes are preparing to take on college athletics, as they signed their letters of intent on National Signing Day on Wednesday in the Media Arts Center.\r\n","date":"2016-02-08 11:42:43","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/DSC_0026.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["andrew liang","athlete","college","eli givens","kathi bowers","kayleigh svensson","media arts center","national signing day","palo alto high school","paly","signing","signing day","sports","sports boosters"]},{"id":115978,"title":"Choir Pops Concert is at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 9 at Haymarket Theater","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/08\/choir-pops-concert-is-at-730-p-m-on-tuesday-feb-9-at-haymarket-theater\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-02-08 09:47:35","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":115960,"title":"Advisory this week is on Tuesday for all juniors and freshmen (L-Z)","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/07\/advisory-this-week-is-on-tuesday-for-all-juniors-and-freshmen-l-z\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-02-07 22:34:38","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":115927,"title":"Paly Quad to Levi&#8217;s Stadium: Students perform at Super Bowl 50","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/07\/paly-quad-to-levis-stadium-students-perform-at-super-bowl-50\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115928\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/12687887_1124695217549030_2321994312789312104_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-115928\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/12687887_1124695217549030_2321994312789312104_n.jpg\" alt=\"12687887_1124695217549030_2321994312789312104_n\" width=\"600\" height=\"451\" \/><\/a> Members of Palo Alto High School's cheer\u00a0and dance\u00a0team pose with a \"Super Bowl 50\" flag before their performance at the halftime show today at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara.

But the Spartans broke through in the 10th minute, when Harris received a through ball at the top of the 18-yard box, drew Paly goalkeeper Linnea Carlstrom out of position and evaded two defenders, finding\u00a0the back of the net for Mountain View's first goal.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the first half stoppage time, Harris\u00a0sent a dangerous chip into the box that resulted in a defensive miscommunication by the Vikings. In the chaos, Mountain View's\u00a0Maddie Neidig tapped the ball through to double the Spartans'\u00a0lead.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Paly's prolific offense, which has produced 51 goals this season, found itself stifled by the Mountain View defense.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">The second half looked like it would be better for the Vikings after they made tactical adjustments, including moving Lu to forward, and created\u00a0several promising chances. But things quickly deteriorated when Pederson limped off the field 10 minutes into the half with a hamstring injury, and Lu came off a few minutes later with a leg cramp.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Left without two of its biggest playmakers, Paly fizzled toward the end of the half, unable to produce chances as Mountain View continued to apply pressure on the offensive end.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe started out the second half pretty well,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cAfter the injuries, it was pretty much an uphill battle.

Despite the setback, she\u00a0emphasized that the team was going to bounce back for the final stretch of league play.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"A\u00a0loss is a loss, and as we talked about after the game, that happened to be an important loss,\u201d Tomz said. \u201cBut we still have four more games to play.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The result\u00a0was particularly frustrating for the Vikings because they were looking to avenge their loss to Mountain View in the the Central Coast Section Division I championship game last year.

Girls' are currently ranked 30th in the nation, and 12th in state according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/high-schools\/palo-alto-vikings-(palo-alto,ca)\/girls-soccer-winter\/home.htm\" target=\"_blank\">MaxPreps<\/a>.\r\n\r\nSeedman emphasizes the team's ability to play through adversity, due to the loss of senior left back Jacey Pederson the past few games to a national team camp.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis week was very tough for us not only because we had three games, but we were missing our best player [Pederson],\u201d Seedman said. \u201cWe were also playing three tough opponents with two games on the road but the girls held up well and won them all.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the season comes to a close, seniors\u00a0Heidi Moeser, Jacey Pederson, Nika Woodfill, Alison Lu, Linnea Carlstrom, and Ansley Queen look forward to\u00a0ending the season on a strong note but also to prepare the team for next season as many key players are leaving for college.\r\n\r\nSenior Captain Heidi Moeser remarks on how the team has added multiple new players.\r\n\r\n\"We added 6 new players this year and they are doing an excellent job, and are really a huge part of this team,\" Moeser said. \"With so many of us leaving next year, I still feel confident in the strength of our team. We've proved drastically what we can do and we look to improve every practice, every game.\"\r\n\r\nGiven the success of the Vikings, senior defender Alison Lu stresses the importance of not allowing the wins to stifle improvement.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have been playing well but there are definitely things we can work on,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThere are still some communication issues on the field and we need to work on keeping possession. Improving that will really help us out. We also know the rising seniors and juniors are strong and will uphold what we've accomplished this season so far.\u201d\r\n\r\nMidfielder Emily Tomz compares this season to the last, emphasizing how they have improved.\r\n\r\n\"Compared to last season, I definitely think we have a greater chance at winning leagues and CCS,\" Tomz said. \"We are a really strong and talented group, with a firm defense, crafty midfielders, and fast forwards who score often and with precision. This year more than last year we have been doing more fitness, which has and will benefit us in games, helping us keep up a high endurance the whole game.\"\r\n\r\nAs the second half of the season approaches, the Vikings continues to stay optimistic about the teams ability to maintain its undefeated record, and constantly looks to improve.\r\n\r\n\"For the rest of this season we are definitely aiming to continue our undefeated streak, and, of course, beat mountain view next Friday,\" Tomz said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will face off against league rivals Mountain View (13-0-1, 6-0-1) on Friday at 3:30 p.m. at Paly.","excerpt":"After an impressive start to the season, the Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 soccer team (12-0-1, 7-0-1) continues to dominate opponents with stellar offense and defense maintaining their undefeated record.\r\n","date":"2016-02-05 10:40:21","author":"Ethan Kao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Homestead-vs-PALY.png","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["CCS","dominate","girls","girls soccer","moeser","pederson","seedman","Soccer","undefeated","vikings"]}]
