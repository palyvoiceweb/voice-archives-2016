Photo: Focus Features[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDid you know that interracial marriage wasn\u2019t always legal in the United States? In the non-fiction, historical-drama film , 'Loving,' directed by Jeff Nichols, the audience follows two main characters \u2014 a black woman, Mildred, and a white man, Richard \u2014 who fall in love and want to get married despite obstacles; however, it\u2019s not that simple.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both lived most of their lives in the small town of Central Point, Virginia, which takes place in the late 1960's, where interracial marriage was illegal at the time, and one was only allowed to marry someone of his or her own race. The movie is told through Mildred and Richard\u2019s eyes. While they were living in Virginia, police arrested them in their own home, in the middle of the night, for breaking the anti-miscegenation laws of their state. They moved to the nation\u2019s capital, Washington, D.C., to get married and to raise their three children. Little did they know that during this time, with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, their experience with the law would be a gateway to make a change for equality.<\/span>\r\n\r\nBoth Joel Edgarton and Ruth Negga do a satisfying job in their roles as Richard and Mildred. They have good chemistry on emotional scenes, such as, powerful expressions on their faces so the audience would figure out what they were feeling. Bernie Cohen, played by Nick Kroll, is the lawer who picks up this case. This character plays as comic relief because he is an ackward person as a result of the words he uses and his posture on scene, which is what Nichols is going for. His partner Phill Bass, played by Jon Bass, is the more serious lawer that keeps him in check. Both of these characters do a good job of creating suspense in the film.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the story unfolds, the audience can't help but side with and cheer on the couple because of the connection they have and everything they have been through. Some people at the time got harassed for being in a multi-racial relationship; they were judged by peers and loved ones. The love that Mildred and Richard share for each other and the conflicted emotions that others have toward them make it clear that this story is going to pull at some heartstrings.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Movie's cinematographer Adam Stone, portrays police in the movie as villains who will do anything to get the protagonists in jail. Stone uses dark lighting and body language well with these characters, highlighting the use of their aggressive nature and atmosphere that is apparent. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, throughout the movie it was hard to understand the dialogue between characters because of their accents and soft voices, which some could argue made the movie more realistic, but at times made the conversations harder to understand.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the movie continues, you feel the injustice of these laws. The government is dictating who people are allowed to love and marry. Mildred and Richard are everyday people who weren\u2019t looking for fame or publicity but rather just wanted what most of us desire, a person to love and be with forever and a chance at happiness. This movie is a must see for those looking for good character development, an authentic snapshot of that time and an emotionally uplifting story that will put you in the shoes of the people who fought against the law.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Loving<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rating: PG-13<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Run time: 123 minutes <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Director: Jeff Nichols<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<b>Actors\/Actresses: Joel Edgerton as Richard, Ruth Negga as Mildred, \u00a0Michael Shannon as Grey Villet, Nick Kroll as Bernie Cohen, Marton Csokas as Sheriff Brooks, Alano Miller as Raymond Green, and Jon Bass as Phil Bass<\/b>","excerpt":"Did you know that interracial marriage wasn\u2019t always legal in the United States?

Stoksik dribbled down the left sideline and around multiple defenders, then passed center to Morabia. Soon after, a Carlmont forward chipped the ball over Paly junior\u00a0goalkeeper Kiran Misner as he ran out to try to stop the attack. After some more attacks on goal and strong defensive play from both sides, the Vikings took the lead again. Sophomore outside midfielder Marco Tan crossed the ball to Morabia for another goal. The first half ended with a score of 2-1.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAt the beginning, we were moving the ball around really well and using the field,\u201d head coach Don Briggs said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half was much less eventful, with no goals scored. Although both teams had chances on goal, neither were able to put the ball in the net. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe definitely had a better first half,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cWe had a lot of opportunities [in the second half], we just didn\u2019t quite put it [the ball] away. We had chances in the second half where, if we put it away, the game would\u2019ve been over.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vikings had matches\u00a0on both Tuesday and Wednesday, which Briggs suspects caused the team to fatigue later on in the game.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYesterday\u2019s game took a little bit of a toll on us,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cWe seemed a little tired and weren\u2019t moving quite as well. We had guys cramping up, which usually means more conditioning [is needed]. That made the second half tougher.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Morabia, Paly\u2019s effort showed through its consistent contact throughout the match.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe had a lot of passion and determination toward the end of the game,\u201d Morabia said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what won us the game.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior center defender and captain Neil Verwillow says that the lack of attack in the second half was executed in an effort to preserve Paly\u2019s lead.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe didn\u2019t have much offensive thrust in the second half,\u201d Verwillow said. \u201cAfter half time, we wanted to preserve the lead rather than extending it.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up, the Vikings will face Lincoln High School at 11 a.m. on Saturday at Homestead High School Stadium.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 soccer team (2-0-0, 0-0-0) triumphed over the Carlmont High School Scots (1-0-1, 0-0-0) 2-1 yesterday at Paly in a preseason match.","date":"2016-12-01 17:55:45","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/DSC_0060.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["atheltics","boys soccer","briggs","carlmont","carlmont high school","jack stoksik","jason shorin","kenzo morabia","kiran misner","marco tan","misner","morabia","neil verwillow","palo alto high school","paly athletics","preseason","shorin","Soccer","sports","stoksik","tan","verwillow","vikings"]},{"id":126331,"title":"Season Preview: Wrestling team hopes to thrive in lower division","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/01\/season-preview-wrestling-team-hopes-to-thrive-in-lower-division\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_116559\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"617\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screenshot-2016-02-18-at-8.50.58-AM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-116559\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Screenshot-2016-02-18-at-8.50.58-AM.png\" alt=\"Members of the Palo Alto wrestling team pose for a picture after competing at the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League Championships last weekend. \" width=\"617\" height=\"422\" \/><\/a> Members of the Palo Alto wrestling team pose for a picture after competing at the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League Championships last season.

Replacing last year's sole senior, Justin Hull, is junior guard Jared Wulbrun.\r\n\r\nExperienced head coach Peter Diepenbrock says the team will thrive off of its returning core players.\r\n\r\n\"The nucleus of the team is largely the same from last year,\" Diepenbrock said. \"But we are one year more experienced.\"\r\n\r\nAfter an unexpected, 54-50, loss to Cupertino High School in the quarter finals of CCS last year, junior guard and three year veteran Max Dorward is fired up to make a deep CCS playoff run.\r\n\r\n\"Last year was disappointing when we lost to Cupertino because they were a very beatable team,\" Doward said. \"We knew we were the better team and knew we had a chance to win it all. I'm very excited to be playing with almost all the same guys this year and to make a deep playoff run.\"\r\n\r\nDorward said the team has gelled over the years, and is ready to leave it all on the court.\r\n\r\n\"We've definitely improved on the aspect of playing with each other,\" Dorward said. \"We've played together for a while now so things seem to be clicking on the court.\"\r\n\r\nSimison said he is pumped for his final year of Paly basketball, and believes that the team's depth will give the Vikings a better shot at the league title and beyond.\r\n\r\n\"I'm excited for the entire season, every single game,\" Simison said. \"We have more players this year that give us a deeper bench and more rest for our starters. This year we plan to win league and get into the open division for CCS.\"\r\n\r\nSchlemmer said he wants to see the stands filled, as this year's team is guaranteed to impress.\r\n\r\n\"Everyone should come watch the games this year because I think this is the best Paly basketball team there has been in a long time,\" Schlemmer said.\r\n\r\nWith one of the top point guards in the De Anza League in Tention, an experienced lineup and the leadership of Diepenbrock, the Vikings are primed to kick off their league season on Jan. 3 against Milpitas High School at Gunn High Schoo","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' varsity basketball team looks to bounce back from a disappointing Central Coast Section (CCS) playoff quarterfinal exit during the 2015-16 season.","date":"2016-11-23 22:48:53","author":"Noah Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_58031-1.jpg","categories":["Basketball","Sports","Spotlight","Uncategorized"],"tags":["basketball","cupertino","diepenbrock","dorward","palo alto","preview","schlemmer","season","simison","tention","vikings"]},{"id":126329,"title":"Season Recap: Football&#8217;s future looks bright with young talent","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/21\/season-recap-footballs-future-looks-bright-with-young-talent\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Palo Alto High School Football team wrapped up its season with a 4-7 overall record and 3-3 league record after a loss\u00a0to the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (8-3, 6-0) in the first round of the Central Coast Section playoffs.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Vikings were carried throughout the season by junior running back Paul Jackson III who accumulated 1266 rushing yards on 222 carries, along with a team leading 12 rushing touchdowns.\r\n\r\nThe season looked promising for the Vikings, who who started off with a 25-12, victory over Patterson High School in the first game of the year.\r\n\r\nSophomore quarterback Jackson Chryst took over at the head of the offense following a concussion to senior starting quarterback Jordan Schilling in the Vikings' week two loss to San Benito High School.\r\n\r\nAccording to head coach Danny Sullivan, the future of the team was set forth from this years' graduating seniors.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to miss some key senior talent and leadership,\" Sullivan said. \"The examples that this year's senior class set is something that I will remember forever. They had to deal with change and they bought into what we are trying to accomplish.\"\r\n\r\nA highlight of the season included defeating the Wilcox Chargers (5-6, 4-2) during a regular season league matchup. The Chargers went on to finish second in the De Anza League.\r\n\r\n\"They were the No. 1 team in the league at the time and we won,\" Schilling said. \"That was one of the best games in my playing career.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' finished fourth in the De Anza League, which secured them a spot in CCS playoffs.\r\n\r\nDespite the early CCS loss, Vikings' first year head coach Danny Sullivan looks forward to next season.\r\n\r\n\"In my first year at Paly, there were some definite challenges by being a new face to the area,\" Sullivan said. \"I am thankful that the school and the players that stuck it out through the season welcomed me to be a part of the program. There were some lows, along with some very big highs for our team this season. Definitely some things that the kids coming up through the ranks can build on for next season.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings look to make a mark next year by starting preparation for the 2017 season soon.\r\n\r\n\"Workouts in the weight room to build strength and conditioning are going to begin in late January,\" Sullivan said. \"We have a goal to show people how much we can improve from one season to the next. In talking with many other coaches around the area, the word is out about how we do things here at Paly. They all know that if the work gets put in, we are a team to be reckoned with in 2017.\"\r\n\r\nAccording the Schilling, the future of Paly football looks promising.\r\n\r\n\"I really think the team as whole improved week to week,\" Schilling said. \"This year was tough because we had to learn a whole new offense and adjust to a new system.\"\r\n\r\nThe team will depend on the talents of sophomore quarterback Jackson Chryst, junior running back Paul Jackson III and junior lineman Bryant Jefferson for leadership in the coming season.\r\n\r\n\"Our program can take drastic strides next season if junior Bryant Jefferson can continue to improve and if sophomore Jackson Chryst can grow as a player on the field,\" Sullivan said. \"If those two have a successful offseason, the rest of the team will follow their lead.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Football team wrapped up its season with a 4-7 overall record and 3-3 league record after a loss to the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (8-3, 6-0) in the first round of the Central Coast Section playoffs.","date":"2016-11-21 21:27:46","author":"Noah Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/los-altos-v-pa.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports"],"tags":["CCS","danny sullivan","football","jackson chryst","jordan schilling","palo alto","Paly football","recap","season","Sullivan","vikings"]},{"id":126113,"title":"Season Preview: Girls basketball seeks to avenge last season&#8217;s early NorCal exit","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/21\/season-preview-girls-basketball-seeks-to-avenge-last-seasons-early-norcal-exit\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115295\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"386\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/julie-jumpman.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-115295\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/julie-jumpman.jpg\" alt=\"Junior forward Julie Chandler leaps in the air as she goes up for an acrobatic layup against Gunn late in the fourth quarter on Friday at Gunn.

The girls team fell to Dublin High School Gaels, 55-49, in the first round of NorCals.\r\n\r\nSenior and fourth year guard Lauren Koyama hopes to put last year's early NorCal exit behind her, and is ready to start the season this winter.\r\n\r\n\"Getting eliminated early definitely hurt last year, but right now we are focused on getting through preseason and league.\" Koyama said. \"We want to peak in February, and we just have to take it one game at a time.\"\r\n\r\nLed by seniors Koyama and Skylar Burris, the team is looking to fill the gaps left by last year's seniors: Maddy Atwater, Alexis Harris, and Courtney Lovely.\r\n\r\n\"We lost three starters last year, one of them being our main source of height on the court. In order to adapt we need to work hard for every rebound and bring the energy that our seniors last year brought [to] every game,\" Burris said.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Harris will have the largest impact on the team, as she led the team in both scoring and rebounding last year, according to Maxpreps.\r\n\r\n\"We have a lot of guards who are capable of making threes, which can make up for the loss of our post scoring.\" junior guard Carly Leong said. \"We need to be more physical when it comes to rebounding, because we are a smaller team, and physicality will make up for it.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the loss, the girls team \u00a0maintain their dominance, having eight of the eleven players returning to the team.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only major change to the program is how many new players we're bringing in. The past couple years we've been playing with basically the same team, and I think bringing some players up from JV and new underclassmen trying out will give us a new dynamic.\" Leong said. \"So far, every practice has been so much fun, and I can't wait for season to start.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe season starts at 7 p.m tonight, with the Vikings traveling to St. Ignatius.","excerpt":"After a 1st place finish in the Central Coast Section (CCS) playoffs and a first round NorCal loss, the Palo Alto High School girls' basketball team looks to return to CCS finals.","date":"2016-11-21 17:20:28","author":"Kasra Orumchian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/julie-jumpman.jpg","categories":["Basketball","Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","basketball","girls","girls basketball","gunn","palo alto","palo alto high school","paly","season preview","sports","vikings"]}]
