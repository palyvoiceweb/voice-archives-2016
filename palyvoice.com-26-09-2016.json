Photo by: Daniella Maydan[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLast fall, I asked if I could pilot the use of MathXL in my Algebra 2, and by second semester, math teacher Natalie\u00a0Docktor and I were both interested in expanding the pilot to our IAC classes,\u201d May said. \u201cMathXL for School is now the official homework platform for all Algebra 2 and IAC classes this year. Ideally, students work the problems on paper, as they would if they copied the problems from the book. The difference is that they submit their answers online to check, rather than turn in the paper.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Docktor, students are given three tries to get a problem correct. There is also the option to use up one of their three tries to view the correct way to solve a problem. After each incorrect try, the program shows step-by-step instructions on how the student should have solved the problem.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While students must complete all of the assigned problems, they only have to get 80 percent of the questions correct for them to receive full credit for the assignment. Additionally, \u00a0If students receive less than 80 percent, they can choose to do additional problems until their percent accuracy rises to 80 percent, meaning that it is always possible for students to receive full credit on their homework assignments, according to May.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to May, a big advantage to completing homework through MathXL is that the program provides instant feedback.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTraditional homework is scored based on completeness and the accuracy of two problems, and the turnaround for feedback was about two class periods, on average,\u201d May said. \u201cUnlike traditionally scored homework assignments, each problem in MathXL is scored as it is submitted and feedback about errors is also given. Another pro is that it is directly correlated to the textbook,\u00a0and since it is produced by the textbook\u2019s publisher, the problems mirror the exercises in the book.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nJunior Alexander Juncosa appreciates the convenience of using MathXL instead of paper homework.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI like this a lot more because it is convenient that you can access your homework at any time or place, just as long as you have a computer,\" Juncosa said. \"This way, you can never lose your homework or forget it at home.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While junior Claire Lin prefers the on-paper homework to online homework, she appreciates the fact that MathXL provides students with example problems.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf I am stuck on a problem the program has similar example problems and they give you step-by-step instructions on how to solve them,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThe program\u2019s example problems are super helpful, especially if you aren\u2019t super strong on solving a particular type of problem.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite its upsides, May and many of the students favor certain aspects of the paper homework.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to May, the largest downside to MathXL is that there may be certain types of problems that are not given through MathXL. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNot every question in the textbook has an accompanying problem in the MathXL system, so some problems I may want to assign aren\u2019t available\u2014such problems would be used as warm-ups or in-class practice,\u201d May said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior Kelsey Lu finds that it is harder to learn when completing math problems online.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you are writing on paper, it enforces organization,\" Lu said. \"It really helps when you want to take a step back. So if you don\u2019t understand what you are doing wrong, writing your homework on paper allows you to go back and look at all of your steps to figure out where you went wrong. I also prefer it when a teacher checks over my work, because on MathXLForSchool you can do something wrong but still get the correct answer and then you will never find out that you didn\u2019t understand the concept.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being made an official part of the Algebra 2 and IAC curriculums, May says that the program\u2019s effect on student performance is not yet clear.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLooking at data from some chapter tests, there did not seem to be a significant difference in test scores for students who used the textbook versus those who used MathXL in the IAC classes,\u201d May said. \u201cHowever, I did see a significant difference in my Algebra 2 students\u2019 test scores. \u00a0However, another variable in that Algebra 2 difference was whether the students did homework, or not. We will be able to make comparisons of last year versus this year\u2019s test scores from Ch. 2 on up.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"Algebra 2 and Intro to Analysis and Calculus are officially introducing MathXLForSchool, an online math homework program, into their curriculum.

Some\u00a0sacrifice\u00a0their voices to scream cheers at lunchtime rallies, others spend countless hours in the auto shop perfecting their floats, and others wake up early every morning to make sure their outfit and face paint will secure their grade that\u00a0day\u2019s best-dressed points. Students with a vast variety of interests and talents all come together during this one week of the school year and unite\u00a0under one common goal: to prove their class is superior.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">The motto of Spirit Week is always to \u201cgo all out,\u201d but is there such a thing as going too far? Last\u00a0weekend\u2019s eruption on the Paly class of 2018 Facebook page surely proves so. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current junior class was filled with anticipation for this upcoming spirit week, following a narrow, yet disappointing, third place loss in 2015. Despite the placement, the class of 2018 gave an outstanding performance given their underclassman status, and look back on it positively.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_110599\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"506\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P5883.jpeg\"><img class=\" wp-image-110599\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P5883.jpeg\" alt=\"The class of 2018 shows off their float at the final rally of spirit week 2015.

Photo by Cooper Lou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many credited the theme, \"lifeguards,\" for the grade\u2019s success last year.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur theme played a huge role in our success last year,\u201d junior Chloe Iglehart said. \u201cMonday\u2019s [theme day] dress up was very consistent and you could tell what our theme was by looking at anyone in our grade. It really unified our class and brought a lot of enthusiasm to the rallies, dance, and float building.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one can imagine, when it came time to vote for the theme that could unify the grade yet again, many felt that it was a make-or-break decision for their chance at redemption during Spirit Week 2016. However, when the results of the final vote were posted, the outcome was anything but unification. Not only was the entire class divided, but many personally attacked other students, accused the Associated Student Body of rigging the vote, and put the success of the class on the line by threatening to withdraw their\u00a0participation. Supporters of the selected theme, the \"70s,\" were quick to reply with equally irrational responses. Within minutes, the class Facebook page exploded into chaos, intense battles in the comment sections, passive-aggressive posts, and innumerable notifications piling up on the lock screens of the junior class. In the end, ASB junior officers succumbed to the pressure and held a re-vote, which resulted in a change in the final theme from \"70s\" to \"boxing.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results of the original vote out of 138 students were 43% 70s, 34% boxing and 23% rockstars, according to Junior Class Vice President Marissa Ludwig. While no theme won by a landslide, it was not particularly close either. Issues were raised over how ASB officers publicized the votes, despite being announced on Facebook, Instagram, and Schoology, as well as in each theme meeting. Boxing won by a landslide in the second vote, which was out of 201 students, but many \"70s\" supporters were forced to surrender their opinions to settle the conflict.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actions taken by many students on both sides of the argument, myself included, were shameful. It was unfortunate to watch how such a passion for Spirit Week could transform into\u00a0something so\u00a0vicious, so quickly.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is obvious that none of the participating students intended for this to get out of hand as it did. Many acted out of character, driven only by their competitive spirit and their passion for the Paly tradition. However, no matter what the reason is, a vote is a vote. The majority selected a theme, and the class should have unified behind it.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of a democratic vote is to find and follow the decision of the majority, whether an individual agrees with it or not. For an event o<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n\u00a0the idea of coming together, threatening to ruin that unity over something as minute as a theme is unfair to the remainder of the class. Especially when that remainder is the majority. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vast number\u00a0of those speaking out on Facebook demanded a re-vote, but a silent majority voted for the winning theme. Both sides had representatives who were frustrated, angry and unafraid to speak their minds. I myself was conflicted on the solution. Should we undercut the significance of a democratic vote, to ensure that our grade be unified to maximize our shot at redemption? After sleeping on it, I feel the results from the original vote should have been upheld.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me make this clear, I did not come to this conclusion based on the fact that the theme of my choice won the original vote. My decision is based on the fact that I feel, through a re-vote, a majority of our class lost their voices. Simply because one is not outspoken, or willing to battle it out on social media to prove their point of view, should not make their opinion any less valuable than those who are. By allowing a re-vote after a decision had already been made, it sends a\u00a0message\u00a0that the loud and outgoing are valued over the quiet and shy, a common misconception in today's society. No matter the class officers\u2019 intentions, sadly, this is the result. Spirit Week is a week dominated by the outgoing extroverts, and one of the few ways that those who aren\u2019t comfortable dressing up crazy and screaming their lungs out can get involved is by voting for what the focus of their week will be. Unfortunately, now that has been taken away too.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nClass unity is by far the most important aspect of Spirit Week, and it is impossible for a class to be unified if the precedent is that half of the\u00a0students do not matter. In the end, we all understand that what makes a grade truly successful during Spirit Week is not a theme, but coming together. Fortunately, I have complete faith in the Class of 2018. We are a class full of passion, energy, and competitive spirit. While we are off to a bumpy start, our divided grade will soon put our disagreements behind us and join together once again. But what will happen for years to come?\r\n\r\nThis is certainly not the first time a class has\u00a0experienced such disorder surrounding a Spirit Week theme. The current senior class suffered a similar fate during Spirit Week 2014, after their preferred theme, USA, was shot down by administration. They quickly made the decision to adopt\u00a0a new theme, \"red card,\" which frustrated many.\u00a0The Class of 2018's recent outburst may\u00a0not simply have been due to a lack of maturity, but representative of a greater issue with Paly's\u00a0entire theme-selection process.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_77275\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"470\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/soph1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-77275\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/soph1.jpg\" alt=\"The class of 2017 dons soccer uniforms in honor of their theme &quot;red card&quot; during spirit week 2014.

Photo by Adele Bloch.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIt is only fair that the Spirit Week theme be decided by the students through a democratic vote to ensure that every student has an equal say in determining their theme. No one will be happy if administration is forced to make these critical decisions for us, but\u00a0if this method\u00a0of Athenian Democracy continues to fall, we may have no other choice.\r\n\r\nOur final option is to, rather than throw our entire system out, simply reform it. Currently, much of selection process is left up to class officers to organize, publicize, and enforce, independent of other grades. This freedom, while it may seem more convenient, complicates the process and creates\u00a0confusion and disorder among the students. Instead of allowing the continuation of this free-for-all in future years, we need to\u00a0standardize our theme selection process for all grades. Each year, freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors all\u00a0need to hold individual\u00a0in-person meetings to discuss ideas during the same week. This should be directly followed by an online poll, that will always take place the following day, and left up for 24 hours. This will minimize confusion about when the poll is up, and give everyone enough time to process the information and make a thoughtful\u00a0decision. This poll can then be followed up by a final vote of the same\u00a0structure between only the top themes, and once the results are in, the decision is final.\r\n\r\nResults of the final vote also need to be publicized. This will squash ridiculous assumptions that the vote was somehow rigged, and allow students to get a sense of where the majority of their class truly lies, instead of being overpowered by the stronger voices.\r\n\r\nFinally, the administration needs to be more vigilant about managing the reaction of students after the final vote. It is not okay to\u00a0react in such a destructive, hostile way, especially surrounding something meant to strengthen\u00a0class unity and cooperation. With more management by administration on this\u00a0controversial issue, students will be forced to communicate in a much more appropriate and construction manner. Administration should also be more clear with regards to which\u00a0themes meet their qualifications, which will avoid last minute chaos and further controversy.\r\n\r\nThese adjustments do not demand\u00a0any major change. They simply require a little more thought than we are currently putting into the process. We can\u00a0stop this cycle before\u00a0the Classes of 2019 and 2020 suffer similar fates to those of 2017 and 2018. Spirit Week is without a doubt one of the most positive high school experiences Paly has to offer, so let's stop marring it with controversy and disharmony, and make it just that much better.","excerpt":"The Class of 2018's recent outburst may not simply have been due to a lack of maturity, but representative of a greater issue with Paly's entire theme selection process.\r\n","date":"2016-09-23 17:38:15","author":"Maya Reuven","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P5883.jpeg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["2018","70s","ASB","boxing","disco","Facebook","juniors","lifegaurds","rockstar","spirit week 2016","unity"]},{"id":122949,"title":"ASB announces joint Gunn-Paly homecoming dance","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/23\/asb-announces-joint-gunn-paly-homecoming-dance\/","content":"In a surprise announcement, the Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body announced that the school's annual fall homecoming dance will be conjoined with the homecoming dance of Gunn High School.\r\n\r\nThe announcement came after much speculation and gossip about the potential lack of a venue for this year's homecoming dance, an issue closely resembling one that occurred\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/27\/asb-announces-homecoming-details-2\/\">last year<\/a> after both Paly gyms were torn down.\r\n\r\n\"The idea came about one day when [Student Activities Director] Matt\u00a0Hall and his wife, [Gunn Student Activities Director] Lisa Hall, were talking about the dilemma Paly was having with trying to find a venue for Paly to rent out for homecoming,\" senior Social Commissioner Isabel Black said. \"Nothing was working out and they got talking and suddenly had the idea.\"\r\n\r\nExcess funds will be redirected toward asking prizes and other amenities rather than bussing and a venue, according to the statement.\r\n\r\n\"Given that ASB will not be spending around $30,000 on bussing and an expensive venue, we are excited to use our budget more appropriately to find the best DJ, decorations, dance setup and include an extraordinary asking prize,\" the statement said.\r\n\r\nSenior Christian Rider is excited for the joint dance due to the fact he will get to reconnect with old friends.\r\n\r\n\"I'm excited for the dance because I went to JLS [Middle School], so a lot of my old friends ended up going to Gunn,\" Rider said. \"It will be nice to reconnect with all of my old classmates.\"\r\n\r\nASB made sure to highlight all the innovative ideas that they're brainstorming to make this homecoming unique and worth remembering.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will be using both of Gunn\u2019s two gyms, where you are free to go between the two as you wish,\" an ASB press release said. \"In addition to food and dancing, there will also be a space for games and non-dancing activities as we hope to cater to every student.\"\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nSenior Ethan Teo is looking forward for the opportunity to build community between the two schools.\r\n\r\n\"I think it definitely will be interesting,\" Teo said. \"I don't know a lot of Gunn people, so it will be cool to get to know them better.

Photo: The Paly Voice.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Paly Voice sat down with Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education members Heidi Emberling and Melissa Baten Caswell separately to discuss their priorities if re-elected to the board and their views on significant community issues. Stay tuned for coverage of non-incumbents candidates of\u00a0the 2016 school board race.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>The Paly Voice<\/strong>:\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are re-elected to school board, what will your main priorities be?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Heidi Emberling<\/strong>: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Main priorities are high quality teaching and learning, investing in our teachers, who are the most important resource in the classroom and managing our resources for enrollment and everything else we want to spend money on at PAUSD.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Melissa Baten Caswell<\/strong>: My first priority is making sure that we have ways for every student to be engaged, actively challenged and learning. In order to do that, we need to have many different types of programs, not just sitting in the classroom and listening but we need to have internship programs and pathway programs. We need to invest in more flipped classrooms and blended classes. We\u2019ve invested in some classes that seem kooky almost but they have engaged a lot of students.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, I want to make sure that, with the teacher shortage, that we\u2019re investing different ways to keep our teachers, train them and develop them. We need to look regionally at how we\u2019re going to support our teachers and other service people that live in the community. We need to make sure that PAUSD is a great place to work.\u00a0The teachers have really the biggest impact on learning but we need to make sure that those teachers want to stay in PAUSD and if somebody offers them a job in a place where they can get cheaper housing or\u00a0maybe get paid a little more it\u2019s not going to be the thing that pulls them away.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third thing is, there\u2019s no point in doing all this investment if our students aren\u2019t ready to learn. We need to make sure that we\u2019re investing in the whole student and that means that their social, emotional and physical selves need to be strong and healthy. We need to realize that you don\u2019t just learn in the classroom, you learn on the playing field, you learn in the theater, you learn during internships, you learn during community service. I\u2019m a huge proponent in investing in the wellness centers that are in our high schools and I\u2019d like to see the wellness centers put in at the middle schools as well. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing is doing more innovative things in the classroom. We\u2019re going to have to give teachers more time to develop these innovative things. Ms. [Lucinda] Filppu couldn\u2019t have come up with Comedy Literature if we hadn\u2019t given her time to develop that class. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then this is not the most interesting thing, but we\u2019ve had a lot of people retire who knew how to do their jobs and they never documented it anywhere, and that\u2019s really a problem so I\u2019d like for us to invest in our system so that things are done a little more systematically. When I talk about that, I mean things like payroll, attendance, evaluation systems and maybe food services. So all these things, if we were able to make them more systemized, I think we could be more efficient, I think we could make everyone\u2019s jobs easier.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: What are your goals for continuing to address mental health problems that students may face?\r\n\r\n<strong>HE<\/strong>: W<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e opened a new wellness center which I\u2019m very happy about and we\u2019ve had a mental health specialist and we\u2019ve expanded services for teens around health and well-being. We\u2019ve added yoga and mindfulness and other ideas like that. It is of primary importance to me to provide educational experiences that meet the needs of students, focusing not only on academic achievement, but also on building skills that develop\u00a0a balanced, healthy life.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>MBC<\/strong>:\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One, we can\u2019t look at the school in a vacuum. We\u2019re part of a community and we have to be working with community resources as well.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other, we need to make sure that we have good services at school for students who need them. I call that a \u201cpainkiller,\u201d when we have a problem, we have services that are appropriate. We also need to work on what I call \u201cvitamins,\u201d and that is to give full and opportunities for students to work around stress and work with you know you make a mistake something went wrong what do you do in those types of situations. We have to make school a safe space to make mistakes because you\u2019re going to get out into the real world and you\u2019re going to make mistakes and there\u2019s gonna be repercussions and if you\u2019ve never had that happen to you, that could be a very traumatic thing. I want to make sure that we\u2019re investing in both sides, on the \u201cpainkiller\u201d side and on the other side as well where we\u2019re trying to create resiliency. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: Studies show students aren\u2019t getting enough sleep and starting school later may be beneficial. What is your opinion on starting school later?\r\n\r\n<strong>HE<\/strong>: I was in support of\u00a0\u00a0eliminating zero period [classes]\u00a0although\u00a0I know some students were not happy with that decision for this very reason. I think sleep is very important for healthy brain development and that we should start school at the right time for teens, which may not be as early as it is now.\r\n\r\n<strong>MBC<\/strong>:\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think if we didn\u2019t have to worry about things like sports and extracurricular activities and after school jobs, I\u2019d say \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s do that.\u2019 But we have a system that we have to work within, so what I would instead suggest is that we have different options that you can choose from. For example, you can take a blended learning class and some of these classes would be in the late afternoon or evening so you could take a prep in the morning. We have to offer some more flexible options and we have to allow students to choose what works with their lives.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: How do you believe PAUSD can change policies on student-teacher interactions after allegations of misconduct against teachers in the district?\r\n\r\n<strong>HE<\/strong>: We have put in place sexual harassment mandatory training for all of our teachers and we've also started to think about student training. We want to make sure that students know when to report when they're feeling uncomfortable around a teacher or another adult authority figure and who they can go to. We really want to work with the Student Council and ASB to see how better we can involve students in\u00a0raising awareness for this.\u00a0It is of paramount importance that our schools are safe for everyone.\r\n\r\n<strong>MBC<\/strong>:\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we can do a better job of documenting what\u2019s proper behavior and what\u2019s not proper behavior. We need to be careful when we do that though, because we do want teachers to be treating their students as if they\u2019re people. We do want to have some connectedness between the teachers and students\u2014just not inappropriate connectedness. I remember a few years ago there were some questions among the club teams who were playing sports in town about inappropriate behavior that happened when coaches were driving an athlete home and what came back was really that a coach shouldn\u2019t be alone with a player. And once that was documented and people were trained on that, then it just stopped.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A teacher shouldn\u2019t be in a classroom with a closed door and no windows even if they\u2019re giving special help to a student. I think we need to be careful though; we could whiplash ourselves into a situation where we have been so constricted with the rule that we can\u2019t have a good environment for interaction either. There are students who don\u2019t have adults in their lives that they can talk to and they have serious issues and sometimes a teacher is that person who you can talk to, and I\u2019d hate for that to go away. I would hate to have a teacher be afraid to talk to a student about a problem, for example.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: Many PAUSD teachers must drive hours each day to teach in Palo Alto. How do you believe the Board can help with addressing this issue?\r\n\r\n<strong>HE<\/strong>: Unfortunately the School District hasn't considered housing. What we can do is partner with the City of Palo Alto and confer with our regional partners to work on housing, housing affordability and availability. Mountain View is doing some interesting things with teacher housing and and we'd really like to partner with them around this issue.\r\n\r\n<strong>MBC<\/strong>:\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that this is a problem that is regional, by the way. It\u2019s not Palo Alto by itself; all the towns around it have the same problem, and I don\u2019t think the school district could do anything really meaningful by itself. So my suggestion is that we figure out how to get the city and the school district talking regionally, with other school districts and cities in the area, and talk about some regional solutions. One thing the superintendent was suggesting is that we have Google buses coming in from the East Bay. Maybe that\u2019s a short term solution, but that\u2019s not a long term solution for a lot of different reasons. If people aren\u2019t living in the community, then they\u2019re not a part of the community. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps for the school district to encourage programs for lower income housing. One of the things I asked assembly member Rich Gordon was \u2018Is there a way for anybody to create housing that is only for a certain group of people, like only for government employees, for example? Can you do it by law?\u2019 I don\u2019t know. These are the things we need to better understand so we can have some good solutions. It needs to be solved as a regional solution and this is also a longer term issue. Palo Alto has been getting more and more expensive for teachers and service people to live here and it\u2019s not just teachers, it\u2019s also policemen and firemen and other service workers as well. So I don\u2019t think we can look at it as teachers in isolation, I think we have to look at it all together.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education members Heidi Emberling and Melissa Baten Caswell to discuss their priorities if re-elected to the Board and their views on significant community issues.","date":"2016-09-22 21:26:47","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Screenshot-2016-09-19-at-8.47.28-PM.png","categories":["Election 2016","Features","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","Board of Education","election","heidi emberling","issues","melissa baten-caswell","palo alto","PAUSD","School Board"]},{"id":122584,"title":"Verbatim: Should marijuana be legalized in California?","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/verbatim-should-marijuana-be-legalized-in-california\/","content":"This November, <a href=\"https:\/\/ballotpedia.org\/California_Proposition_64,_Marijuana_Legalization_(2016)\" target=\"_blank\">Proposition 64<\/a> is going to be on the California ballot.
