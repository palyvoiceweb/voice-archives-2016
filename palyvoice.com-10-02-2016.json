Carlson was very pleased with how the activity went.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe goal of this activity is the same as our club's overall goal: to get people talking about mental health and to create a space for people to open up about it in order to diminish the stigma,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cI am pretty pleased. We had a bigger turnout than I was expecting so that was exciting.\u201d\r\n\r\nCarlson hopes that the club's message can reach more people through the events it plans to host in the near future.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are going to be pretty active during March,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWe plan on doing some more activities out on the Quad, and then we are going to have some smaller campaigns that we are going to be launching.

Their chemistry and passionate\u00a0performances create\u00a0a movie truly worth Best Actress, Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. Photo: Fox Searchlight Pictures.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A touching immigrant story that transports audiences into 1950s New York, \u201cBrooklyn\u201d is a romantic drama, filled with rich history and emotion. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The storyline, based on Colm Toibin\u2019s 2009 novel \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d tells the tale of Ellis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan), a young Irish woman who immigrates to New York. There, she faces the same struggle as the millions of immigrants that traveled to the United States, which is the need to assimilate to an unfamiliar way of life and the melancholy yearning for a faraway home with no hopes of returning. Ellis begins to enjoy her life in New York more when she falls for a friendly Italian-American plumber, Tom (Emory Cohen). However, after Ellis visits her hometown, she is faced with temptations from a local, Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson), and is torn between the two lovers.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viewers easily connect with the protagonist and are engrossed by Lacey\u2019s captivating journey to overcome\u00a0alienation in a new, unfamiliar environment.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director John Crowley takes the audience through the complexities of each character and lets the actors in the film shine. Every performance is full of emotion and evokes a sense of nostalgia. Ronan, Irish-born herself, delivers a stunning performance that quickly captures the heart of the audience. Ronan\u2019s character Lacey begins her journey as someone shy and inexperienced in the real world, and we see her grow into her true self throughout the movie. However, this inner transformation is subtle, for Ronan\u2019s character is not a fearless, larger than life heroine, but instead a very real woman struggling to find her place in the world. With\u00a0quiet strength and determination, Ronan is able to captivate the audience and bring the story of Ellis Lacey to life. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The costumes are\u00a0very well selected and do an exemplary job of enhancing the setting of the era. In particular,\u00a0in the scene at Coney Island, Lacey and Tom both wear\u00a0baggy, bright colored swimsuits authentic to the time period.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although \u201cBrooklyn\u201d has a large number of outstanding elements, the character development is generally lacking in the supporting cast. There is little insight into the life of the other characters in the story. Even with the sincerity and kindness of \u00a0Cohen\u2019s character, he remains largely two-dimensional despite being the main love interest. This is primarily\u00a0due to Crowley\u2019s intentions to illustrate small moments in the main character's life. However, there is\u00a0little to no insight into\u00a0the other characters in the story, although it clearly builds the potential for further development.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cBrooklyn\u201d feels like the result of a grandchild\u2019s inquiry into her ancestors. As a drama, it\u00a0paints a gritty and touching look into one young woman\u2019s journey. The film is not afraid to illustrate the loneliness\u00a0of an immigrant alone in a new country, but\u00a0does so in an intimate and refreshing manner.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBrooklyn\u201d is up for three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actress. Ronan\u2019s outstanding performance as Lacey arguably deserves Best Actress and the film has a good shot at Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u201cBrooklyn\u201d<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 hour, 51 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated: PG-13 for a scene of sexuality and brief strong language<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by John Crowley<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Starring: Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen<\/strong>","excerpt":"A touching immigrant story that transports audiences into 1950s New York, \u201cBrooklyn\u201d is a romantic drama, filled with rich history and full of emotion, and deserves its Oscar Nominations of Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actress.

Photo by William Zhou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to streamline research, the Palo Alto High School Library recently purchased\u00a0its new<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paly.net\/academics\/library\">\u00a0One Search Discovery Tool<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like the name suggests, One Search Discovery aims to simply research by aggregating the library's various research tools into one page, according to Paly librarian Rachel Kellerman.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne Search Discovery is a global search engine that connects most of the library\u2019s research products,\u201d Kellerman said. \"As consumers we don\u2019t want to click a lot, everyone wants products where you can get to the meat of the product as fast as possible.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, the librarians are working on introducing students to One Search Discovery. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe challenge is always marketing,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cI\u2019m working on an online tutorial, and librarian Sima Thomas went into all the AP Psychology classes to demo the tool. My goal is to go into all the social science courses so that every senior touches this product before he or she leaves.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through their tutorials and visits, the librarians hope to familiarize students with One Search Discovery's many features, according to Kellerman. <\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cIn addition to searching, you can also filter specifically for books in the library, e-books and books published within a certain date range,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIf you are at home, you can also access the database through the library libguide. The nice thing about the e-books is that you can search for specific words in the books and the e-books aren't one to one, so the whole class could be looking at the same book. Furthermore, you can create folders, save books and access them anywhere, it\u2019s very much like a Google Drive environment.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the school's contract with its previous research tool expired, the librarians had been looking for a new system that could make research faster. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe old system for searching was very, very slow,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIf you needed a book, you would have to go to the library catalog, then if you wanted a database article you would have to go the library libguide, then if you wanted an e-book you would have to go the e-book catalog. Nothing was integrated. The old library system that we had was\u00a0more designed for middle school students.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the librarians hope that this new tool will help prepare students for college research.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSimilar search tools to One Search Discovery are found in colleges and universities,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to use, but like a new app on your phone it's good to practice before you have pressure for a research report and we wanted to expose students to it beforehand.\u201d \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Kellerman, the adoption of the One Search Discovery tool is representative of Paly\u2019s willingness to innovate and explore. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe're one of the high school that vendors [of software] will look at because we will try things out,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIn the spring we\u2019re going to a user's conference day that mostly has colleges, but we\u2019ve been invited because Paly really has that forward looking attitude.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the librarians discovered One Search Discovery last year, it has taken around nine months to get it up and running and they\u2019re still some areas which need to be improved. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou still need to click through a couple pages to access the text for the e-book,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cAnd some research tools like The New York Times and ABC Cleo aren\u2019t integrated.\u201d \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student reaction has been positive so far,\u00a0according to Kellerman. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe best reactions I got were \u2018I found it!\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m going to use it.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Alice On\u2019s opinion reflects Kellerman\u2019s view. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d On said. \u201cI tried it in my AP Psych class and there were some glitches, but other than that, it\u2019s pretty cool and convenient. It\u2019s like the entire library on your computer, I think I\u2019ll use it in the future.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Library recently launched its One Search Discovery Tool in an effort to streamline research.","date":"2016-02-08 11:48:23","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/photo.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["faster","Kellerman","one search discovery","paly","research","streamline"]},{"id":115917,"title":"18 senior athletes commit to schools on National Signing Day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/08\/18-senior-athletes-commit-to-schools-on-national-signing-day\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115919\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/DSC_0026.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-115919\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/DSC_0026.jpg\" alt=\"Seniors Katie Francis and Andrew Cho sign their college athletic letters of intent on Wednesday in the Media Arts Center.

It\u2019s one that not many kids get to experience.\u201d\r\n\r\nLiang credited Paly for preparing students, academically and otherwise, and offered some helpful advice to the college-bound athletes.\r\n\r\n\u201cPaly has prepared you extremely well for this [being a college athlete],\u201d Liang said. \u201cYou should continue to use the skills you have learned over these your four years and apply them in college. There will be ups and downs, just like there were in your four years here.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Givens, who will be playing Division 1 football at Southern Utah University, this day served as an affirmation to his dedication to athletics throughout high school.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have worked so hard for this,\u201d Givens said. \u201cFrom coming to school at 7 a.m, to just working out to get bigger and stronger, to giving it 110% during practice. Even if I didn\u2019t get an offer, I know that I worked hard enough to get one. This is an amazing feeling and I\u2019m really glad that this happened to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nNot all of the Vikings who signed to a college will be competing in Division I athletics.

The new menu will also feature complete dishes, called signature entr\u00e9es, that can be added as sides to a main meal, such as the\u00a0the\u00a0student favorite \"Burroti Bowl.\" Examples of these signature entr\u00e9es include the Chicken Tikka ($8.50) and the Asian Tofu ($8).\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cRight now at Tava, customers are able to pick a protein, topping, chutney and a sauce and if we were to add in more individual options it would very quickly become overwhelming,\u201d Founder Hasnain Zaidi said. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is instead is to create blends as well as separate dishes for people to choose from, allowing for more variety but not to overwhelm the customer.\u201d\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\nZaidi said that the variety in the menu will be appreciated by frequent customers.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we started Tava, we deliberately kept it [the menu] small and simple to not overwhelm our customers and to be able to do everything really well,\u201d Zaidi said. \u201cBut what we found was that for the folks who visit often, like students at Paly, having more options would allow them to create different combinations and choices.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The founders hope to learn more about how to shape new aspects of the Paly student special by launching a student <a href=\"http:\/\/Http:\/\/palysurvey.telltava.com\" target=\"_blank\">survey<\/a> to gather ideas.\u00a0Ideas include offering a free garlic naan instead of the free fountain drink that currently comes with the Paly special.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne of the things we want to do with the special is to actually have a conversation with students and to figure out what it is that they want in a special,\u201d Zaidi said. \u201cWhether it's adding let's say a garlic naan instead of a soda or removing both and having the price be cheaper, we want to make sure the special we offer is the special that students want rather than what we think they want.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the overhauling changes, the restaurant will be closed this week to spend time training the staff to produce the updated menu.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe are going to close for a week, mostly to train our crew and touch some stuff up,\u201d Zaidi said. \u201cIt takes time to learn how to prepare the new recipes and it's essential our staff does it right.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to CEO Jeremy Morgan, the restaurant will re-open on Thursday, Feb. 18 and will offer free food for all Paly students.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Zaidi, students who answer the aforementioned survey\u00a0may be randomly selected to try\u00a0the new menu in a special VIP testing opportunity.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the current popularity of the restaurant, Zaidi says that the changes will augment Tava\u2019s quality and hopes that the changes will endear themselves to current and new customers alike.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s pretty scary to take something that is working and change it,\u201d Zaidi said. \u201cBut at the same time we are just so excited about this new approach because it takes all of the best things we have today and adds new elements to it.\u201d <\/span>","excerpt":"Tava Indian Kitchen will be implementing a new special for Palo Alto High School students as well as changing its menu as the restaurant prepares to update its Palo Alto location.","date":"2016-02-07 21:05:39","author":"Chirag Akella","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Untitled-1.png","categories":["Features"],"tags":["Hasnain Zaidi","palo alto high school","paly","Paly Special","survey","TAVA"]},{"id":115927,"title":"Paly Quad to Levi&#8217;s Stadium: Students perform at Super Bowl 50","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/07\/paly-quad-to-levis-stadium-students-perform-at-super-bowl-50\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115928\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/12687887_1124695217549030_2321994312789312104_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-115928\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/12687887_1124695217549030_2321994312789312104_n.jpg\" alt=\"12687887_1124695217549030_2321994312789312104_n\" width=\"600\" height=\"451\" \/><\/a> Members of Palo Alto High School's cheer\u00a0and dance\u00a0team pose with a \"Super Bowl 50\" flag before their performance at the halftime show today at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara.
