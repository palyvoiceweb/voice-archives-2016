On the day of tryouts, athletes will hand the Health Clearance Card to their coaches.\r\n\r\nWhile the application process remains mostly the same, the only change is the new method for coaches to verify that an athlete is cleared to participate, even during tryouts.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt puts coaches in a tough position when the student would say \u2018I am getting it [my physical clearance] tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018I uploaded it to Appryse, I don\u2019t know why you can\u2019t see it,\u2019\u201d Bowers said. \u201cCoaches were having to spend too much time dealing with the physicals instead of working with their athletes, so what would happen is that some coaches would not take the time to verify that the student was cleared to participate.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents may pick up the Health Clearance Card in person on Friday from 2 to 4 p.m., and\u00a0on Monday\u00a0from 11:30 to 4 p.m. in Room 725.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School athletes are required to complete a new athletic clearance process for the spring season in an effort to better verify a student's eligibility to play a sport.","date":"2016-01-28 22:22:56","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/DSCN3235.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["appryse","bowers","card","clearance","kathi","new","physical","requirement","sports","spring"]},{"id":115117,"title":"Newseum CEO to discuss freedom of expression at MAC","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/28\/newseum-ceo-to-discuss-freedom-of-expression-at-mac\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115118\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"466\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/mac.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-115118\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/mac.jpg\" alt=\"The school\u2019s Media Arts Center will host Newseum CEO, Jeffery Herbst as part of the Media Arts Center\u2019s Speaker Series.\u201cThere will be two more later this spring,\u201d Event Organizer and Palo Alto High School Journalism teacher Esther Wojcicki said.

Photo by Emma van der Veen.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education took a stance against the creation of a third high school at Cubberley Community Center during the school board meeting on Jan. 26.\r\n\r\nThe board discussed several proposals set forth by the Enrollment Management Advisory Committee. Among these was the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/01\/26\/new-school-or-not-school-board-to-debate-cubberley-question\/\">proposal to create a new high school at the Cubberley Community Center<\/a>, advocated for\u00a0by PAUSD Superintendent Max McGee. Despite a more favorable outlook for the proposal in previous board meetings, after further discussion, school board members expressed both hesitation and opposition\u00a0to\u00a0the creation of a new high school.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to put millions of dollars behind helping ideas that have already been formed,\u201d board member Melissa Baten Caswell said.\r\n\r\nDespite a majority dissent from the board during the meeting, McGee remained loyal to the ideal of creating a new high school.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think there are some bigger issues [involving Cubberley] we need to discuss before dismissing a new high school,\u201d McGee said.\r\n\r\nBoard members Ken Dauber and Terry Godfrey echoed Caswell\u2019s opposition to the new high school at Cubberley, which currently serves many community functions. In\u00a0contrast, board members Heidi Emberling and Camille Townsend expressed support for the creation of a subsequent task force to investigate the idea further.\r\n\r\n\u201cA third high school is important,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in experimenting. I do, however, believe in choice programs. I don\u2019t see a whole-scale changing of our schools.\u201d\r\n\r\nDistributing the responsibilities of the potential task force and allowing the staff of the already existing high schools to conduct their own reforms would serve the district much better, according to Caswell and Godfrey. Caswell recognized the community's interest in new schools, though emphasized that they were not a current necessity for the district.\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel the need to parse things as well,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cLet\u2019s first decide if we want these schools. I personally don\u2019t feel we need new schools, we want them.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Caswell, City of Palo Alto officials also need to take part in the decision to redesign Cubberley's use.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow we use Cubberley needs to be in collaboration with the city,\u201d Caswell said.\r\n\r\nDauber supported the improvement of current schools, pointing out the need for programs that promote the social and emotional well-being of PAUSD students.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be helpful to factor processes into different groups with different focuses,\u201d Dauber said. \u201cI appreciate the work that\u2019s gone on here because for me what\u2019s really surfaced is this really strong desire for the improvement of our schools.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe school board is set to officially vote on the proposal for a new high school at Cubberley on Tuesday, Feb. 9.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education took a stance against the creation of a

regarding tenures, salaries and peer review.\r\n\r\nA salary increase is the top priority for many teachers due to<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0their inability to find or maintain homes\u00a0in and around Palo Alto amid the region's rising living costs.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many teachers fear the continued increases in housing prices will\u00a0not allow them to continue to work for Palo Alto\u2019s schools, according to Corey Potter, Hoover Elementary School kindergarten teacher.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight:

and now we are being priced out of renting a one bedroom apartment.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some teachers believe that a pay raise is justified because similar local

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The higher costs of living that are not supported by salaries cause teachers to live as far away as Santa Cruz, like Walter Hays Elementary School third grade teacher\u00a0Tara Hunt. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA typical day for me is to wake up at 4:45 a.m. so I can leave by 5:15 a.m.\u00a0to take a two-hour commute to Palo Alto from Santa Cruz,\u201d Hunt said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Living outside of the district and its neighboring cities makes it difficult to participate in school activities,

However, Baten-Caswell says that based on enrollment data, she is not convinced that a new school is needed to fix overcrowding issues.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf we don't need a new school, do we want a new school?\u201d Baten-Caswell said. \u201cI think that's really the question we need to ask at this point is do we want a new school, not whether we need it. But there are some people, including the committee [Enrollment Management Advisory Committee], that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pausd.org\/sites\/default\/files\/pdf-faqs\/attachments\/EMACSecondarySubcommitteeFinalReport.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">think our schools are too big<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baten-Caswell notes that at the elementary school level, one solution could be shifting the flow of students so it\u2019s spread evenly throughout all the elementary schools. The board will discuss elementary school boundary lines at the meeting.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI'd say I don't believe we do [need to open another elementary school], but I do believe we need to rejigger boundaries so we're not overflowing kids from the same school,\u201d Baten-Caswell said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to create a new school will require a lot of thought and contemplation of the consequences, including the impact on the community center aspect \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because Cubberley really belongs to the community<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d according to Baten-Caswell.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cConceptually, I think starting something new is fun,\u201d Baten-Caswell said. \u201cAre you willing to use some of your money and some of your people's time to do it? That means that they won't be able to spend that same time and money on existing programs. You have to decide if that's the most important thing.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McGee aims to be mindful of the district\u2019s mission: to improve the preparedness of students and enrich their educational opportunities.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think that even more importantly they [EMAC] pointed out to really think about student connectedness, about opportunities and access, about how to make our schools even better than the excellent schools they already are,\u201d McGee said.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education will discuss plans for a possible new school at Cubberley and future investments into schools at the board meeting at 6:30 p.m. today.
