I\u00f1\u00e1rritu returns after winning\u00a0the Academy Award for Best Picture for \"Birdman\" last year to share a gut-wrenching journey of a man fighting against the unstoppable forces of nature to achieve vengeance.<\/p>\r\nThe movie follows the mostly true story of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), an expert tracker and hunter who suffers from a violent bear attack during a fur-trapping expedition in the 1820s. His companion, John Fitzgerald (Tom Harding), leaves him in the forest to die after killing Glass's son (Forrest Goodluck), who tries to fight Fitzgerald. Glass becomes a legend when he manages to claws his way through thousands of miles of frozen wasteland with open wounds on\u00a0a\u00a0hunt for vengeance. A story of adversity and justice is eclipsed by one of personal development and rebirth, as every imaginable obstacle is thrown at Glass, only for us to see him emerge alive, but barely breathing.\r\n\r\nDicaprio\u2019s performance is raw and haunting. The audience watches him scrape marrow out of frozen bones, catch a fish with his bare hands and cling for his life on a piece of driftwood at the whims of an immense river, and as we root for him all the way. Despite roughly a dozen lines of dialogue, DiCaprio maintains a strong vigor in his eyes that chills to the bone. In the end, this is DiCaprio's film through and through; he is completely committed in every terrifying moment, pushing himself further than he ever has before as an actor and proving himself more than deserving of that \"overdue Oscar.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The supporting cast's performance is equally raw and truthful, particularly that of Tom Harding, who manages to encompass the villain of lawless and ruthless\u00a0frontiersmen, as well as Domhnall Gleeson, who plays the solemn and well-intended captain of the fur-trapping expedition. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of what makes watching \"The Revenant\" more entertaining is knowing the cast and crew of the survival story also went through multiple struggles to make it. I\u00f1arritu took the cast and crew on a nine-month shoot in the wildernesses Alberta and Argentina. What's more, contrary to the norm, he insisted on filming in chronological order and in natural light.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Revenant\u201d is not for the light-hearted. The gore and blood encompasses the rough and uncertain reality of life on the frontier during that time. This further heightens the intensity of this gripping survival story.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the greatest achievements of the film is the way it manages to juxtapose the immense beauty of nature to the unforgiving conditions of life that stumbles alongside it. This is made possible through the sublime cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, who captures the the dark brutality of man in a scene when DiCaprio first finds the body of his son. The ragged breaths of a barely-breathing man fog up the camera lens as Dicaprio gazes at his son\u2019s body, serving to embody the panic and rawness of his\u00a0emotions. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lubezki effectively proceeds to sweep us up in the ineffable beauty of nature, showcasing static shots of snow dripping from the tips of evergreen trees and vast expanses of iced valleys and churning rivers. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie plays on the contrast between nature and man; every step of the journey feels treacherous yet simultaneously\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beautiful.<\/span>\r\n\r\nI\u00f1arritu turns a gruelling frontier mythology into an ethereal, treacherous odyssey that continues to linger in your mind, haunting, for days after.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Revenant\u201d is nominated for the following 11 Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Director, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Cinematography, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Film Editing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Costume Design, Best Sound Editing, Best Production Design, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Mixing. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Revenant\u201d deserves to win \u201cBest Picture,\u201d \u201cBest Actor<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Director\u201d and \u201cBest Cinematography\" for its\u00a0ability to capture an audience with gripping\u00a0camera work and its raw and authentic performances.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u201cThe Revenant\u201d<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2 hours, 36 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated:\u00a0Rated R for strong frontier combat and violence including gory images, a sexual assault, language and brief nudity <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by\u00a0Alejandro G.

Photo courtesy of the Orlando Sentinel.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDespite the brilliance that is \u201cBridge of Spies,\u201d its reception by the public has been underwhelming.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is due to the contrast of director Steven Spielberg\u2019s other explosive action films with the slow suspense of his latest work \u201cBridge of Spies,\u201d but nevertheless the film reveals itself magically. The story, based on true events, takes place at the height of the Cold War as both the United States and the Soviet Union\u00a0grapple with fear and suspicion. The plot centers on a Brooklyn-based artist, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who is found to be a Russian spy. This threatening discovery affirms America\u2019s worst fears and causes an outbreak of panic and hatred.\r\n\r\nAlthough Abel seems destined to \u00a0hang, the government attempts to display the superiority of democracy by ensuring him a fair trial. They assign him a successful insurance lawyer, James Donovan (Tom Hanks). Hanks\u00a0plays his typical character masterfully\u2014he\u2019s charismatic, approachable, but not afraid to shake things up. Due to his respect for the fundamentals of due process, Donovan agrees to the case. To his surprise he develops a personal connection with Abel. Hanks and Rylance\u2019s on-screen chemistry is part of what makes the movie so captivating.\r\n\r\nAs Abel's unfortunate fate looms closer, across the country an American spy plane disguised as a weather plane is shot down over the Soviet Union. Suddenly Abel has a hope for a prisoner exchange.\r\n\r\nThe film is long, in typical Spielberg manner, and the beginning is at times\u00a0uneventful, trading action for obvious symbolism and intricate camerawork. Yet the second half, when Donovan is sent to a post-war Berlin, turns out to be the most enthralling, insightful part of the film. Donovan is asked by the U.S. government to work as a third party to arrange the swap. He must travel through both devastated East and West Berlin, as beautiful cinematography captures the stark differences in the two sides both visibly and economically even just after the wall has come up; The West is filled with tantalizing stores and light, and the east dark and hazy with young gangs on every corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cBridge of Spies\u201d received six Oscar nominations this year for \u201cBest Picture,\u201d \u201cBest Original Score,\u201d \u201cBest Production Design,\u201d \u201cBest Sound Mixing,\u201d\u201cBest Original Screenplay,\u201d as well as \u201cBest Actor in a Supporting Role,\u201d for Rylance\u2019s performance as Abel.\r\n\r\nRylance delivers an exceptional yet nuanced performance, often overshadowed by more dramatic dialogue. While his performance\u00a0is notable, its\u00a0subtlety will most likely take away Rylance\u2019s prospect of winning \u201cBest Actor in a Supporting Role,\u201d especially considering the other strong candidates.\r\n\r\nBoth Hanks and Rylance give stellar performances, yet the real treasure of \u201cBridge of Spies\u201d is the portrayal of ethical uncertainty Donovan must face. While American society and media easily paint Abel as a communist villain, Donovan can see he\u2019s truly just a patriot, doing what he must for his country.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Bridge of Spies\"<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2 hours 21 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated PG-13 for some violence and profanity<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by Steven Spielberg<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Starring Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Alan Alda, Amy Ryan, and Billy Magnussen<\/strong>","excerpt":"In \"Bridge of Spies,\" Tom Hanks portrays James Donovan, an affluent American lawyer who has been asked to defend a Soviet spy.
