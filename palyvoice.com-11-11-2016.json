The golfers competed for the last open individual spot at CIF.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite seeing her season end along with her teams, Yu remains happy with the end result. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think we had a really strong team this year,\u201d Yu said. \u201cI was really hoping that we would be able to make it to States, but making it to NorCal was already pretty great, since we only made it to CCS last year.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choi has a slightly different view from Yu. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the team for making it that far even though we didn\u2019t play as well as we could\u2019ve,\" Choi said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Choi says she believes that the team\u2019s main focus should be tournament practice.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe definitely need to practice more and be prepared for big tournaments,\u201d Choi said. \u201cWe also need to play more 18-hole courses as a team because it's different from playing \u00a0nine-hole courses.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nine-hole courses are the standard matches that the Vikings played during the regular season against other schools. Tournament play consists of 18-holes, which is significantly longer. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The success of the team this year is a major step up from the 2015 season.

On Nov. 3, two days after the deadline, advisory was held\u00a0for seniors for the first time in over two months. \u00a0This ineffective\u00a0schedule has led to confusion and stress for seniors currently going through the college application process.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly created the Teacher Advisor system in part, to provide guidance for students as they navigate post-high school planning.\u00a0<\/span>However, the lack\u00a0of senior class advisories has created chaos and confusion during a critical time in students' high school careers. \u00a0While current seniors could still\u00a0benefit from an improved advisory system, it is imperative that Paly implement more college-oriented advisories for future senior classes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seniors applying to college expect guidance from their TAs, however, this is not possible if advisories aren\u2019t scheduled. \u00a0Although students are able to set up individual meetings with their advisors, mandatory advisories have to be implemented so all students are motivated to receive the critical information about the whole process.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College form deadlines that are set by Paly, such as those for the Cover sheet or the NACAC form, an application to receive financial aid, have\u00a0left seniors in a state of confusion. \u00a0Also, leading up to and on the due date of transcript orders, students served as peer advisors warning friends about the deadline; had an advisory been scheduled for the previous week, the chaos could have been avoided.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to TA coordinator Ann Deggelman, seniors have all the information they need to know about applications.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe set up the calendar so it\u2019s the same every year,\" Deggelman said. \u00a0\"At the end of junior [year] there are a lot of junior advisories preparing them for senior year and post college planning.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior year advisories do prepare students\u00a0well for upcoming events\u00a0and for taking standardized testing; however, seniors do not have all the information they need to know about applications during the actual process. Students also receive the Viking Guide at the beginning of their junior year. This guide is not very beneficial because there is a great amount of information in them that students are not able to navigate through without the guidance of advisors.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While beneficial to prepare students ahead of time, many misplace materials or forget essential information and deadlines over the summer. Additionally, the substantial amount of information given during junior year can be overwhelming and should be spread out over the course of senior year. \u00a0Seniors need to have advisory during the actual process so their TAs can guide them through the applications in real time\u00a0and remind them of deadlines or timelines they should be currently aware of.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While one of the last advisories for seniors did review early applications and financial aid for students, the meeting was held on Sept 1., two months before the actual application deadlines. \u00a0Many students did not retain all this information, nor did they carry it with them for over six weeks.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Andrea O\u2019Riordan believes that more advisories are necessary for seniors.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think the cover letter was briefly mentioned [last advisory] but other than that I don\u2019t remember much else that we did,\u201d O\u2019Riordan said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advisory system is meant to help students through the confusing times of college applications, but the insufficient advisory schedule makes seniors feel like Paly admin threw a great amount of information at them and then left them on their own through the actual college application process. \u00a0It was created with goals that include helping\u00a0students connect with their advisors as well as\u00a0reduce stress throughout their post-high school planning, but until more senior advisories are implemented with actual information about current timelines or deadlines, the system is not fulfilling its purpose. \u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"While current seniors could benefit from an improved advisory system, it is imperative that Paly implement more college oriented advisories for future seniors.","date":"2016-11-10 09:52:26","author":"Morgan Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/CCC-Photo.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["Advisory","college","college applications","early","new","Nov 1","opinion","revamp advisory","seniors","shortage","Stress"]},{"id":125886,"title":"There is no school on Friday, Nov. 11 due to veterans day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/10\/there-is-no-school-on-friday-nov-11-due-to-veterans-day\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2016-11-10 09:42:27","author":"Chirag Akella","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":125652,"title":"Liveblog: 2016 elections results","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/08\/liveblog-2016-elections-results\/","content":"Voters across the United States will be selecting their future president along with an array of local and state politicians today.\r\n\r\nTune in to see The Paly Voice's liveblog of all local, state\u00a0and national elections.\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>11:33 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump will be the 45th president of the United States.\r\n\r\n<strong>9:56 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThanks for tuning in to The Paly Voice's liveblog!

He won this by saying things we thought you couldn't say,\" says an NBC reporter.\r\n\r\n<b>9:07 p.m.<\/b>\r\n\r\nFun Fact #9: It is important to note that the electoral college can vote for whomever they want, even if the voters in their state choose otherwise. Throughout American history, although there have been instances where electoral members have voted for someone other than who the public voted for, it has never changed the outcome of the election.\r\n\r\n<strong>9:02 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton's popular vote is at 47% to Trump's 48%.\r\n\r\nAs of now, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania are too close to call. However, Trump is still projected to win.\r\n\r\n<strong>8:47 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nProposition 53, which requires statewide voter approval for bonds over 2 billion dollars, is split by 50%.\r\n\r\n<b>8:44 p.m.<\/b>\r\n\r\nJohnson and Stein take up a total of 2.7% of popular votes.

Trump's lead has shrank by a little bit, but is it enough?\r\n\r\n<strong>7:37 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAP hasn't updated the results in a long time.

Polls in California close in about half an hour.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:18 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThere are many states too close to call. \u00a0Wisconsin is slowing inching towards Clinton. New Hampshire remains red.\r\n\r\n<strong>7:08 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAt this point, it looks like it will be very difficult for Democrats to capture the Senate.

Minnesota also trending blue. Wisconsin and Michigan still trending red.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:48 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton is slowly gaining votes in Virginia. Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin are all trending red. I think we may be seeing the Brexit effect in the United States.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:43 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWith 90 percent voting in Virginia, Trump is ahead by 16,000 votes.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:41 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf Trump wins the election, I will be very disappointed in many the polls that showed Clinton ahead.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:38 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton can afford to lose North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire and Arizona if she\u00a0holds her other firewall states. Unfortunately for Clinton, Virginia currently leans red. So does Minnesota and Michigan.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:33 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIs anyone else really surprised by how close the\u00a0results are so far? I thought Clinton had it in the bag.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:28 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton still trails Trump, this time 97 to 129 electoral votes, according to AP.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:20 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"It's incredibly how tight all these races are,\" an NBC reporter says.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:13 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMichigan is extremely close, with Trump in the lead by a few hundred votes.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:05 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton now trails in the electoral college with 97 votes to Trump's 123, after Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Texas voted red while New York voted blue.\r\n\r\n<strong>6:00 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAccording to AP,\r\n\r\nClinton has won: DE, DC, MD, MA, NJ, RI, IL and VT (68 electoral votes)\r\n\r\nTrump has won: AL, IN, KY, MS, OK, SC, TN and WV (66 electoral votes)\r\n\r\nOther news organizations are reporting different demographics.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:56 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAccording to ABC News, Republicans will retain control of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:52 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton has not lead in Virginia all night. This will concern her supporters, as the state was considered by many pundits to be a safe state for her.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:44 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFun Fact #5:\u00a0Hillary was part of the presidential impeachment inquiry of President Richard Nixon.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:42 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton leads in Michigan and Pennsylvania, both of which are too early to call. Trump and Clinton are both beginning to solidify leads in a\u00a0plethora of other states.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:35 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"We are feeling really good ... It's\u00a0still early, but we're\u00a0feeling really good about the ground we have\u00a0mustered,\" a Clinton spokeswoman says.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:32 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNBC reporters are highlighting the importance of Florida, where Trump currently has a slight edge. \"It becomes increasingly difficult for Trump to win without Florida.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>5:29 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump has won Tennessee and Alabama, securing 60 electoral votes to Clinton's 44.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:18 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAP shows that Trump now has a slight lead in the electoral college, with 51 votes to Clinton's 44.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:17 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn the Senate race, Democrats lead in New Hampshire, North Carolina and have won Connecticut and Maryland. Republicans have won Ohio, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Florida and are leading in Indiana, Alabama and Georgia.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:14 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNote: The Paly Voice will not be able to begin reporting on local polls until at least 8 p.m., as that is when polls here closed.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:09 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump is ahead in Texas, Tennessee and Alabama. Clinton wins Delaware. Clinton is ahead overall, 44 electoral votes to 31, according to Associated Press.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:07 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nElection Fun Fact #3: If elected, Trump would be the second\u00a0president to be divorced.\r\n\r\n<strong>5:02 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAssociated Press reports that Trump won Oklahoma; Clinton won Maryland, New Jersey &amp; Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:55 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"All eyes are on New York, where the polls are closing,\" an NBC reporter says.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:51 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNBC has called South Carolina for Trump.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:41 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton now leads in New Hampshire; Trump leads in Ohio.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:37 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump is leading in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia &amp; New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:34 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nElection Fun Fact #2:\u00a0A candidate has lost the election after winning the popular vote\u00a0four times. The last was Al Gore versus George W. Bush in 2000. The others are: Grover Cleveland in 1888;\u00a0Samuel Tilden in 1876; and Andrew Jackson in 1824.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:32 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump has won West Virginia (with five electoral votes). According to NBC, Trump supporters should be worried by Clinton's current lead in Florida.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:31 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPolls have closed in Ohio, North Carolina and West Virginia. South Carolina is leaning towards Trump.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:30 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFlorida is now leaning blue again. Is it just me, or does Florida always make elections 10 times more wild?\r\n\r\n<strong>4:28 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are in the Bay Area and still need to vote, polls will be open for 3.5 more hours.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:22 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAs the votes come in, many swing states are flipping back and forth in terms of who is in the lead. Trump takes the lead in Virginia and Georgia. Florida is extremely competitive; Trump is ahead by three percent.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:21 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAccording to NBC, the candidates are the least popular Presidential candidates in history.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:16 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nResults from Virginia are beginning to be revealed. Clinton leads, 50 percent to 45 percent, with about 7,000 votes counted.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:12 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump is leading Clinton, 57 percent to 28 percent, in Florida. However, Florida's major liberal cities have not tallied their votes yet.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:10 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSenator Marco Rubio (aka \"Little Marco\") is currently ahead in the Florida senate race.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:07 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTo pass the time, we will be peppering this liveblog with election fun facts!\r\n\r\nFun fact #1:\u00a0At 70, Donald Trump would be the oldest candidate to be elected as a first-term president. Ronald Reagan was 69 when he won his first term, and 73 when he won for the second time.\r\n\r\n<strong>4:03 p.m.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nClinton has won Vermont; Trump wins Indiana.

The Morning Conduct carried out a <a href=\"https:\/\/morningconsult.com\/trump-clinton-unpopular\/\">survey<\/a>\u00a0asking voters who disapproved of the two candidates about the reasons for their views. To nobody's surprise, Clinton haters called her a liar, and 56 percent of voters think Trump is a racist. So why should anyone look up to either of these two as our president?\r\n\r\nWell, the answer lies in our country's roots. America has always been\u00a0a nation driven by compromise: it is what allows us to function and thrive as a country. Our unique ability to work together despite sometimes having starkly differing\u00a0opinions is imperative for finding middle ground on important issues and ultimately solving them.\r\n\r\nGenerally we live in a country where there is a division of power amongst the two major political parties. It is rare for Democrats or Republicans\u00a0to hold the White House as well as a majority in both houses of Congress, meaning that most\u00a0of American history has been\u00a0comprised of inter-party collaboration.\r\n\r\nWhen we sacrifice our willingness to cooperate we give up our power to solve problems and continue to move forward as a nation.\u00a0Part of what makes our political system\u00a0so special is that we don't quit.\u00a0Every four years\u00a0roughly\u00a0half the population is disappointed by the outcome of the presidential election, and that's just the nature of the system. However upsetting the result may be to some people, we all continue to work together\u00a0in the meantime, and the losers simply try again in four years.\r\n\r\nThe worst decision Americans can truly make is to fail to honor the sacred electoral system that holds our great nation together. These next four years will\u00a0be one the most consequential periods of modern American history, and we cannot look at issues like the war on terror and restoring the American economy with minds turned away from the idea of collaboration.\r\n\r\nWe could all spend the next four years complaining about how this November forced us to choose between the lesser of two evils, but where would that get us? I implore you, in an election season overrun by paranoia and hate, to see our next president as the leader of our nation, not the face of the party you didn't vote for.","excerpt":"Regardless of whether you're \"with her\" or if you want to \"make America great again,\" it is our duty as citizens of the United States to support our president, even if we have to grin and bear it.","date":"2016-11-07 22:01:50","author":"William Sallomi","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trump-and-Clinton.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["Clinton","Donald Trump","election 2016","Hillary Clinton","Politics","Trump","voting"]},{"id":125467,"title":"Paly students: Who&#8217;s voting and why","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/07\/paly-students-whos-voting-and-why\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2016 presidential election will no doubt go down in history as one of the most intense, controversial and chaotic elections in the history of the United States, but also as one of the most important national decisions. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Americans are tasked with choosing between presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, both of whom have run campaigns riddled with scandals, leaving some voters with an extremely difficult decision to make.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_43954\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"478\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/2012-11-06-08.09.12.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-43954\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/2012-11-06-08.09.12.jpg\" alt=\"Voters wait in line inside Palo Alto High School's Tower Building to cast their vote.

Photo by Phoebe So.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That decision also rests on the shoulders of approximately 60 Palo Alto High School students, according to Karla Larson, Guidance Tech Assistant. Within just weeks \u2014 and in some cases, days \u2014 of turning 18 years old, a few lucky juniors and seniors have the chance to utilize their newfound rights and leave their mark on this year's election.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For senior Tanner Newell, who turned 18 this past September, the decision to vote was difficult. He ultimately decided against voting in both the presidential and local elections. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m not going [to vote],\u201d Newell said. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough time and I have other responsibilities.\u201d\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Newell emphasized that if he did find the time to vote come Nov. 8, he still would not participate in the local elections, because he will be moving out soon.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf I do vote, it will just be to the presidential,\u201d Newell said. \u201cI'm not going to be in Palo Alto for the local elections to affect me.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many eligible Paly students have decided to vote in the local and presidential elections this Tuesday.\u00a0<\/span>Senior Matthew Seto credits his duty to vote in both elections to his time as a Boy Scout.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs Boy Scouts, we were taught about a duty to our nation, and voting was one of those obligations,\u201d Seto said. \"It helps determine the future of your local community, as well as [the nation's.] Getting youth to vote is also very important as voting turnout in California is lower than the national average.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeto emphasized that this specific election was not the basis of his decision to vote.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I still would have voted, regardless of the candidates or propositions on each ballot,\u201d Seto said. \u201cEven though California is dominantly Democratic, each vote for a policy or candidate still carries weight and importance.\u201d\r\n\r\nOthers, like senior Ibby Day, feel that this presidential election is especially crucial to vote in.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm voting because this election matters to my future, and my peers' futures. Every vote does count, especially in this election,\u201d Day said. \u201cI'm voting for Hillary Clinton because I respect her as a candidate, and my political priorities align with her priorities the most. The President is essentially the most powerful person in the world, and to think that Trump, someone who is careless with his words and actions, might be in a position to make crucial decisions is absolutely terrifying.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenior Ethan Bundy also feels\u00a0that voting is essential, despite the unlikelihood of his candidate winning in California.\r\n\r\n\"Although I know my vote most likely won't make a difference because my political views are the opposite of approximately 99 percent of the people in California, I am still going to vote because people have died to give me the right to do so and in a lot of countries around the world people don't have that right, so I think it is disrespectful for people not to give their vote,\" Bundy said. \"Also, I am not voting for Hillary because I cannot vote for someone who is supposed to uphold the law when time after time she exhibits behavior that shows she believes she is above the law.\"\r\n\r\nMany view voting as a good way to remain informed about politics.\r\n\r\n\"Before I vote, I have to be reasonably well versed in current politics,\" senior Brian Tracy said. \"This is good information to stay up to date on and it allows me to have interesting discussions with my friends.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for other students, it only takes a small incentive to motivate them to get to the polls on Nov. 8.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI'm just looking forward to voting so I can get the \u2018I voted\u2019 sticker,\u201d senior Andrew Vargha said.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"Within just weeks \u2014 and in some cases, days \u2014 of turning 18 years old, a few lucky juniors and seniors have the chance to utilize their newfound rights and leave their mark on this year's election.","date":"2016-11-07 17:47:52","author":"Maya Reuven","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/2012-11-06-08.09.12.jpg","categories":["Election 2016","News","Spotlight"],"tags":["18","Andrew Vargha","brian tracy","Clinton","day","donald","election","election 2016","ethan bundy","hilary","ibby day","local elections","matthew seto","President","presidential","propositions","seniors","Seto","student voters","Trump","Vargha","voting"]},{"id":125512,"title":"The education argument \u2014 why students should support Clinton","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/06\/the-education-argument-why-students-should-support-clinton\/","content":"In a presidential election torn between unpopular candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, many voters will be holding their noses as they vote or won\u2019t be voting at all. This is especially true for younger demographics, who have the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2016\/05\/16\/478237882\/millennials-now-rival-boomers-as-a-political-force-but-will-they-actually-vote\">lowest voter turnout rates<\/a> in the nation. While the candidates\u2019 policies have been largely overshadowed by political scandals and heated bickering, their views on primary and higher education will no doubt have lasting impacts on American students.\n\nClinton\u2019s education plans, while flawed, provide much greater benefits to students and most Americans as a whole. Trump\u2019s plans, on the other hand, will degrade the public school system and have limited effects on nearly all\u00a0college students.\n\nClinton is pursuing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hillaryclinton.com\/issues\/college\/\">bold and expensive plan <\/a>on making higher education more accessible. According to her website, her top priorities include making community college free, funding minority-majority colleges and assisting student parents. Most notably, she plans to make public colleges tuition free for families with incomes at or below $125,000 by 2021. On the topic of student debt, Clinton has proposed cracking down on predatory schools and lenders, cutting loan interest rates and offering a three-month moratorium on student loan payments to federal loan borrowers.\n\nClinton\u2019s plans will no doubt be an asset to lower-income families who cannot afford to send their children to college as well as to students buried in debt. Her plans have also earned her the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aft.org\/resolution\/endorsement-hillary-clinton\">endorsement<\/a> of the American Federation of Teachers union. By making college more accessible to all students, her plan will greatly increase the number of students completing some form of higher education.\n\nThe main problems with Clinton\u2019s plans are cost-related. According to the higher education writer and political analyst Kevin Carey, Clinton\u2019s original education plan, based on making community college free, was economically feasible. However, after adopting many of Bernie Sanders\u2019 policies,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/07\/20\/upshot\/the-trouble-with-hillary-clintons-free-tuition-plan.html\">her new plan became extremely expensive and would reward states that spend the least money on students.<\/a>\u00a0An increase in tax rates on the wealthy would likely be needed to fund her ambitious program.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has no specific plan on student debt or even college in general. His claim that the federal government shouldn\u2019t profit from student loans is a positive statement but far from the set\u00a0of policies that America needs. In September,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/articles\/life\/inside_higher_ed\/2016\/09\/what_is_donald_trump_s_plan_on_college_affordability.html\">he revealed his goal <\/a>of pressuring academic institutions with large endowments to spend more on students or lose their tax-exempt status. This would be a helpful action for some college students, but only for those who attend universities with multi-billion dollar endowments. Moreover, it is impossible to judge Trump\u2019s plan for college education because he doesn\u2019t even have one outside of the two simple statements outlined above.\n\nTrump\u2019s primary education plans are significantly better than his college education plans, but that isn't saying much. An enthusiastic proponent of \u201cschool choice,\u201d Trump believes that students should be able to attend any school they wish, public or private. This policy choice is interesting and could have the power to improve the educations of lower-income, minority students. However, it carries some significant flaws. Though Trump has touted such plans time and time again, he has never specifically stated how he will finance the $20 billion initiative. Given his opposition to raising taxes, the costs would likely either add to the federal debt or result in cuts to other parts of the current education budget.\n\nSchool choice also furthers the degradation of public schools by taking money away from the public school system. Furthermore,\u00a0because many private schools are religious, allowing\u00a0tax dollars to pay for private schools that subscribe to a particular faith is a blatant violation of the constitutional separation of church and state,\u00a0according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publicschoolreview.com\/blog\/the-ongoing-debate-over-school-choice\">Public School Review<\/a>.\n\nTrump\u2019s opposition to Common Core is a plus, as its standards are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernjournalism.com\/common-core-fundamental-flaws\/\">not based on sound research<\/a> and\u00a0have resulted in<a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernjournalism.com\/common-core-fundamental-flaws\/\"> lower test scores<\/a>, according to Western Journalism. However, the United States president has no power to repeal these standards, as they were adopted at a state level, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/ed\/2016\/09\/25\/494740056\/donald-trumps-plan-for-americas-schools\">NPR<\/a>. Furthermore, ending Common Core is not a magical solution to America\u2019s education problems. By basing nearly his entire education platform on denouncing these standards, Trump is ignoring issues plaguing American students that are not affected by the Common Core, such as nationwide achievement gaps and student debt.\n\nClinton\u2019s K-12 plans, on the other hand, are probably more expensive yet simultaneously more far-reaching. While Trump\u2019s school choice would push students to leave public schools, Clinton aims to go to the root of the problem by improving public schools themselves. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hillaryclinton.com\/briefing\/factsheets\/2016\/02\/18\/ending-the-school-to-prison-pipeline\/\">Her website outlines specific policies <\/a>on elevating the quality of teaching, investing in run-down schools and helping each student learn computer science. When compared to Trump\u2019s simple viewpoints on K-12, Clinton's plans help combat a broader range of education problems.\n\nUnfortunately, Clinton has never stated how she will finance these new plans, and given the billions of dollars she has pledged to invest in this area, it is unlikely that simply reprioritizing the current budget will allow her to pursue these policies. As a result, Clinton\u2019s extensive K-12 education plan will help students at the expense of higher taxes on the upper class\u2014a consequence that is arguably relatively minor as it\u00a0will likely affect few people.\n\nClinton\u2019s policies have their own expensive flaws, but they greatly outweigh Trump\u2019s college and K-12 education plans\u00a0as they actively attempt to limit student debt and address primary education problems ranging from run-down schools to teaching quality. In the end Americans will have the final say: By casting a vote, we will\u00a0choose either debt reduction and college accessibility or a bleak future for students.","excerpt":"Clinton\u2019s education plans, while flawed, provide much greater benefits to students and most Americans as a whole while Trump\u2019s plans will degrade the public school system and have limited effects on most college students.","date":"2016-11-06 20:34:17","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Screenshot-2016-11-06-at-4.01.42-PM.png","categories":["Election 2016","Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","Clinton","college","Community","donald","education","election","Hillary","K-12","Trump","University"]},{"id":125463,"title":"Football clinches spot in CCS with victory over Mountain View","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/11\/06\/football-clinches-spot-in-ccs-with-victory-over-mountain-view\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Palo Alto High School football team (4-6, 3-3) is preparing for its first game in the Central Coast Section playoffs after it defeated the Mountain View Spartans (5-5, 2-4) on Friday night, earning the Vikings a spot in the playoffs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a tough loss to Los Gatos High School (7-3, 6-0) on Oct. 21, and a bye week, the Vikings bounced back and beat the Spartans.
