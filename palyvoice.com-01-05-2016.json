Our student athletes learn lifelong skills,\u00a0but with very limited financial support for Athletics from the school district.\u00a0Paly Sports Boosters is charged with raising the necessary funds to ensure Paly\u2019s competitiveness on the field. Paly Sports Boosters currently funds the vast majority of Paly\u2019s Athletics budget including for more than 45 teams in a variety of sports.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeveral items will be for bid this weekend, Anderson explains.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere will be lots of great stuff,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cSports memorabilia, once in a lifetime experiences, sports, camps for younger kids, spa treatments, workout passes, and more.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe full auction catalog can be seen\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1mNsfPwbFplGNOq2U9eISEfQb-Tb_MC4Bsa2OsTu4cdQ\/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">here.\u00a0<\/a>\r\n\r\nThe event will include various forms of auction, according to Anderson.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost of the items will be part of the \u2018Silent\u2019 auction,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cMeaning we\u2019ll have bid sheets on tables and people will go around and write down their bid on the items they want. Whoever is the highest bidder at the end of the night, buys that item for that price. We will also do a live auction for five or six really special things like the Klay Thompson signed basketball and the golf outing with the new football coach.\u201d\r\n\r\nAttendees can expect not only an auction, but also a social gathering \u00a0with other Paly parents, according to Anderson.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big, fun party in a beautiful back yard with lots of great things to bid on and fun fellow Paly parents to hang out with,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice way to wrap up the Athletic year!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe auctions have been successful in the past and this year, sports boosters feels optimistic towards raising even more money.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a Sports Boosters auction in 2013 which raised $20K,\u201d Anderson said. \u201c In 2015 it raised $30K and now in 2016 we\u2019re hoping to raise $50K.\u201d\r\n\r\nInterested community members can sign up\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/this-saturday-the-paly-sports-boosters-silent-auction-cocktail-party-fundraiser-tickets-22591245022?aff=ehomecard\" target=\"_blank\">online here.<\/a>\u00a0Tickets are $50 each and are available online or at the door.","excerpt":"Ever want to own a piece of Palo Alto High School history or eat pasta with Principal Kim Diorio?

While the protest generally remained peaceful, several brawls broke out between pro-Trump and anti-Trump attendees, and metal barriers surrounding the hotel were removed by protesters hoping to interrupt Trump\u2019s speech inside the hotel.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dozens\u00a0of police officers were dispatched to the scene after crowds attempted multiple times to enter the building, first through the front entrance and side doors and later by crossing an overpass linked to the car garage.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, protesters\u00a0carried signs with angry messages including \u201cMr. Hate leave my state,\u201d \u201cTrump is a rapist and conman\u201d and \u201cDump Trump.\u201d Others played\u00a0musical instruments or form barriers by linking arms.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Veria, one of hundreds of protesters, says she attended the demonstration to show her children the importance of being civically involved.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s so easy right now to sit back behind your phone screen or to be on social media being upset about things, but to actually take action is important,\u201d Veria said. \u00a0\u201cWe want to lead by example. We feel very strongly that these are not the values we want our children to grow up on and that they [Trump\u2019s values] are dangerous for the type of world we trying to build together.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other protesters cited Trump\u2019s alleged sexism or racism as reasons for protesting.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI hate Trump,\u201d said Sheila, who declined to disclose her last name. \u201cI hate that he\u2019s fascist. I hate that he hates women. I am Muslim, he says all Muslims are terrorists. Do I look like a terrorist?\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many protesters were eager to express their anger. Attendees carried Trump pi<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00f1atas and threw eggs at Trump cardboard cutouts, while others threw eggs at the hotel windows and shouted expletives at police officers for committing \u201cpolice brutality\u201d after several protesters were shoved and arrested by officers for attempting to enter the building. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of Trump's\u00a0supporters bore signs condemning the protesters, resulting in some hostile confrontations.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palo Alto High School junior Andy Chang attended part of the protest and says that Trump remains popular because he can connect with conservative voters\u2019 deeper fears.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI agree with many Republican values, however, I do not support any Republican candidates. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are just disgusting human beings,\u201d Chang said. \u201cThe media said that people vote for Trump is because he is \u2018tapping into the fears\u2019 of the people, a \u2018successful\u2019 businessman having confidence of not being politically correct, and so on. Most of their reasons are accurate. I remember the first time the media criticized Trump because he said many illegal immigrants are criminals, drug dealers and rapists, and the US should build a wall for them. This speech is indeed very extreme. But the general idea of strictly protecting the U.S. border is not extreme.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The protest largely dispersed by 2:30 p.m., when the shrinking crowds were told to leave by police because of unruly behavior. However, protesters say their ideas were loud and clear, as they hope to send a message that they will not tolerate hate in California.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<em>Photos by Aidan Maese-Czeropski.<\/em>\r\n<div id=\"cp_widget_200fe1a5-9848-416d-b12d-7346d9195816\">\r\n\r\n...\r\n<div id=\"cp_widget_aaef29d4-589b-4c16-b143-6380aa755a6a\">\r\n\r\n...<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\/\/ <![CDATA[\r\nvar cpo = []; cpo[\"_object\"] =\"cp_widget_aaef29d4-589b-4c16-b143-6380aa755a6a\"; cpo[\"_fid\"] = \"AcNAxf9oWZUK\"; var _cpmp = _cpmp || []; _cpmp.push(cpo); (function() { var cp = document.createElement(\"script\"); cp.type = \"text\/javascript\"; cp.async = true; cp.src = \"\/\/www.cincopa.com\/media-platform\/runtime\/libasync.js\"; var c = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; c.parentNode.insertBefore(cp, c); })();\r\n\/\/ ]]><\/script><noscript>Powered by Cincopa <a href='http:\/\/www.cincopa.com\/video-hosting'>Video Hosting Platform<\/a> for Business solution.<\/noscript>\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Hundreds of protesters including several Palo Alto High School students chanted messages and waved political banners to demonstrate against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at the California Republican Convention yesterday in Burlingame.","date":"2016-04-30 12:09:27","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/IMG_7076.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["2016","burlingame","donald","election","hyatt","presidentiale","protest","Republican","Trump"]},{"id":119645,"title":"Annual Team Math competition to be held Tuesday","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/29\/annual-team-math-competition-to-be-held-tuesday\/","content":"The Annual Team Math competition, run by Palo Alto High School\u2019s Math\u00a0Club, will be held this Tuesday from 3:15 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. in the math building.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students will compete in teams of three to solve math problems and are encouraged to find group members that are in a range of different math classes. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"We want teams to match up people from a diverse range of math classes in order to give everyone an opportunity to compete, so we designed a point system based on the highest math class a participant has taken,\" said junior Jerry Hong, co-president of the Math Club.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hong, groups must have between 8-10 points in order to compete, with the point distribution working as follows:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ATM_Pts.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119650\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ATM_Pts.png\" alt=\"ATM_Pts\" width=\"600\" height=\"700\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hong, the ATM competition features three rounds: an individual competition, a team round, and a \"guts\" round, where the teams solve problem sets and get graded in real time.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to senior Lilia Tang, co-president of the Paly Math Club, the club added new features to the competition this year.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[The math club] had a lot of fun writing the contest this year,\" Tang said. \"We even added a new round called 'guts,' where participants can see their results updated live, and part of it includes estimation questions where you get partial credit depending on how close you get to the answer.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participating students will get free pizza and receive extra credit from their math teachers.

The district has implemented numerous protocols aimed at responding to tragedy after previous suicide clusters\u00a0involving district students occurred in 2009-2015. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">District Supt. Max McGee sent a letter notifying parents of the incident\u00a0on Saturday, though at the time, details surrounding the death were unknown.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday morning, some teachers read aloud a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1_pSSub74GYZ6eT4Kql0Q3k0Oe0csPZ3F_0uklKRTG5s\/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">message from the administration<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to their first period classes, informing students that Sarah Longyear, a 2014 graduate of Gunn High School, had died by suicide. The message also directed students to various mental health\u00a0related\u00a0resources<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Additionally, Diorio sent teachers a link to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tXQB7Mu5_BM&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that provides guidelines for discussing mental wellbeing with adolescents.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Diorio, administrators were\u00a0unsure as to whether they wanted to prepare a standardized script for teachers to read off to students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe just thought, and given how connected our students are with Gunn, that we wanted to be on the same page as them,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIt\u2019s that balance \u2014 we don\u2019t want to ignore this, and act like it didn\u2019t happen, and at the same time, we have to be careful about how we message it.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the individual who died was an alumna rather than a current student, Diorio says district officials were more measured in their direct outreach to students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe wanted to see how yesterday would unfold, before checking in directly with kids,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe wanted to give them the opportunity to come to us on their own, if they need support. When it was our own student, or when it was a current Gunn student, we were much more specific in identifying kids we wanted to check in with. We took it more case by case, instead of doing a universal check-in.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diorio says that she hopes\u00a0the teachers who needed additional support talking to their classes could have received it. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think one thing maybe I would have done differently, if a teacher was in that situation, I would have seen if we could have partnered them with someone who could have been in the classroom and talked with the kids,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough time to put that plan together.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, Diorio\u00a0encourages students, parents and staff to be there for each other and be proactive in combating issues relating to mental health.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s keeping those conversations about mental health going, talking about it, noticing when people might be struggling,\u201d Diorio said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Santa Clara\u00a0County Public Health Department is scheduled to release on May 4 the preliminary findings of its <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/13\/county-to-begin-health-investigation\/\" target=\"_blank\">Epi-Aid project<\/a>, an investigation aimed at combating student suicides which began in February.\r\n\r\n<em>A list of school and community resources is available on the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paly.net\/crisis-resources\">Paly crisis resources page<\/a>.

Photo: Jianhao Meng.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing a three-year streak, the Palo Alto High School Science Olympiad Team placed second out of 28 teams at the North California Science Olympiad State competition on April 16, in Turlock.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team fell to Mira Loma High School from Sacramento by 27 points, according to sophomore Celine Wang, a\u00a0member of the green team, or varsity team. The SciOly competition is split into two teams: the green team, akin to a varsity team, and the white team, or the junior varsity team. Except for one year, Mira Loma has consistently won first at states since 2005, according\u00a0to their <a href=\"http:\/\/scioly.org\/wiki\/index.php\/Mira_Loma_High_School\">SciOly wiki page<\/a>. The only time this changed was in <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/05\/21\/paly-scioly-team-makes-impressive-debut-at-nationals\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2013<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when Paly beat Mira Loma and advanced to the Science Olympiad National Tournament and placed 16th. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/scioly.org\/wiki\/index.php\/Palo_Alto_High_School\">Paly SciOly's wiki page<\/a>, Paly has placed in the top three teams in States\u00a0since 2010.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMira Loma is an incredibly strong school,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIt is second in the nation as of last year. Considering we ended up pretty close to them is an achievement in itself.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Wang, the goal of teams at SciOly competitions is to get the lowest score possible, similar to golf. Higher-placing teams receive fewer points, while lower-placing teams successively receive higher scores. Competition events<span class=\"_5yl5\">\u00a0consist of testing, lab work and building, where teams build devices\u00a0before the competition which are then tested onsite. Events range from building a robot arm to <span class=\"_5yl5\">testing identities of unknown powders.<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough the team was somewhat disappointed that we were still stuck in a frustrating second place, we still improved from last year by three\u00a0points,\u201d sophomore green team member Chloe Hong said. \u201cIn fact, this is the smallest point gap between us and Mira Loma that we have had in all the years that we have placed second at States.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the frustration, the team did well overall and finished in the top five in many events, according to senior team captain James Wang.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEvent-wise, we did well across the board during States,\u201d James Wang said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s preparation for their tests and builds really showed during the awards ceremony. I believe we placed 5th or better in 19 out of the 23 events.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With many seniors leaving next year, some club members have voiced their anxiety about the team's future success, as Hong says that the green team will lose half of its members. SciOly adviser Ron Bowditch says he is not worried about filling the holes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have promising, bright and hard-working students coming up the ranks,\u201d Bowditch said. \u201cThe thing that is going to be different is that we are going to have a lot of students that are now on the Jordan SciOly team. Jordan did not have a SciOly team up until three years ago, so we will have a few students who were on the [Jordan SciOly] team before, giving them more experience with the competition.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to James Wang, the next step would be to find adult mentors who could help students study for their events.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere is a huge wealth of science expertise in Palo Alto that we have not really tapped [into] yet,\u201d James Wang said. \u201cI am sure that mentors would really speed up our studying and engineering processes.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nPaly's competitor, Mira Loma, has various\u00a0adult mentors that work with students one-on-one, according to Bowditch. However, he does not see Paly heading in that\u00a0direction.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI personally do not really like that idea,\u201d Bowditch said. \u201cI think the team should be completely student-run and student-focused; so when they win, it will be that much sweeter.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nMembers are excited for next season and for what it may hold.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"_5yl5\">\"I am really sad the season's over, especially since we'll be losing so many amazing seniors, but I cannot wait for the all the fun times next season,\" Celine Wang said.\r\n<\/span>","excerpt":"Continuing a three-year streak, the Palo Alto High School Science Olympiad Team placed second out of 28 teams at the North California Science Olympiad State competition on April 16, in Turlock.","date":"2016-04-25 21:27:08","author":"Julia Qiao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Scioly-States-story.jpeg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Bowditch","Celine Wang","chloe hong","competition","james wang","North California Science Olympiad Competition","paly scioly","science","scioly","states"]},{"id":119505,"title":"Fire alarms stall classes","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/04\/22\/fire-alarms-stall-classes\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_119526\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Fire-alarm.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-119526\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Fire-alarm.jpg\" alt=\"Fire alarm\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/a> Students converge on the football field during the start of first period.

According to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson, construction workers in the Performing Arts Center accidentally triggered both alarms.\r\n\r\nThe first fire alarm went off before school started, forcing bewildered students to line up on the football field during the morning rain.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was raining outside and the construction workers didn\u2019t evacuate, so I was suspicious that a student pulled the alarm as a prank or to avoid their first period,\u201d junior Annabelle Hu said. \u201cI was pretty miserable in the rain. \u2026 It was a monumental waste of time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Gaby Pelayo was\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">recording a presentation in her third period Advanced Placement Spanish Language class when the fire alarm interrupted midway \u2014 ruining the recording. With the AP Spanish exam less than two weeks away, Pelayo\u00a0says she feels the alarm was untimely.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"We were in the middle of doing practice for AP Spanish test this coming May,\" Pelayo said.\u00a0\"It was a bit annoying as it disrupted our time in class and our practice. All fire alarms are a hassle but considering the [AP] tests are around the corner, our classes need to be as productive as possible.\"\r\n\r\nWhile today\u2019s alarms were accidental occurrences, Paly is not a new victim of false alarms. Approximately six fire alarms have disrupted classes this school year, according to Berkson.\r\n<div class=\"conversation\">\r\n<div data-reactroot=\"\">\r\n<div class=\"_4tdt\">\r\n<div class=\"_4tdv\">\r\n<div class=\"_5wd4 _1nc7 direction_ltr\">\r\n<div class=\"_5wd9\">\r\n<div class=\"_5wde _n4o\">\r\n<div class=\"_5w1r _3_om _5wdf\">\r\n<div class=\"_4gx_\">\r\n<div class=\"_d97\">\r\n\r\nBerkson says that since fire alarms have occurred frequently, some students might be caught off guard in the case of an actual fire in the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen it does happen, hopefully everyone is prepared and takes it seriously,\u201d Berkson said.\r\n\r\nBerkson debunked suspicions that the first fire alarm had been caused by a cooking mishap in the Media Arts Center, stating that the administration\u2019s switchboard showed that the alarm was triggered\u00a0elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Two fire alarms disturbed Palo Alto High School students and staff today during first and third period.","date":"2016-04-22 23:21:06","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Fire-alarm.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["1","3","alarm","Alto","annabelle","Berkson","fax machine","fire","gaby","hu","junior","Palo","paly","pelayo","period","spanish"]}]
