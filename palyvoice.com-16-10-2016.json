We are hosting this as a sort of community service,\" Beverine said. \"We're trying to help out those families that don't have insurance, or have a limited insurance plan. If someone is paying out of pocket, the price can be $50\u00a0or more for a physical. We're doing it for $10 and the money we raise\u00a0we send back to the high schools.\"\r\n\r\nJustine Iongi, the head athletic trainer for Paly is one of the many high school athletic trainers partnered with the program. Every trainer\u00a0has a direct line with the Stanford athletic trainers, giving them the ability to call Stanford when they are in need of their services at the press of a button.\r\n\r\n\"This\u00a0[program] unified us as a team to be better able to catch small things that we might have been unable to catch before,\" Iongi said. \"We can now send our athletes for more detailed screenings and get them the care they need faster.

However, besides these climate changes, the true quintessential signifier of autumn\u2019s beginning comes in the form of pumpkin spice. <\/span>\r\n\r\nBusinesses around the Bay Area, complying with the mass hype surrounding pumpkin spice, are busy producing ridiculous assortments of pumpkin drinks, snacks and desserts. Unlike themed holiday products, pumpkin spice is not in celebration of any particular event, but the excitement\u00a0 that seems to follow it seems to be worthy of its own form of holiday.\r\n\r\nPeet's Coffee and Tea has recently released a completely new menu with an assortment of pumpkin drinks. These include the Pumpkin Latte, the Pumpkin Chai, the Pumpkin Mocha, and the Pumpkin Javiva.\r\n\r\nIs this seasonal collection really equivalent to \u201cfall in a cup\u201d? Does pumpkin really go with everything, even chocolate? The Paly Voice decided to test out what this pumpkin spice craze was all about.\r\n\r\nBelow we<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> have picked three areas to judge: Aesthetic, Taste and finally Fall spirit.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16805121_3eaf1771b375b8abbf09622cf012db5473431e79.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-123898 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16805121_3eaf1771b375b8abbf09622cf012db5473431e79.jpeg\" alt=\"new-piktochart_16805121_3eaf1771b375b8abbf09622cf012db5473431e79\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We started off with the Pumpkin Latte ($3.75 for a small), a creamy coffee topped with a small peak of white foam. It looked like your average Peet's latte, with equally creamy blend of milk, and strong coffee but with slight hint of what could be inferred to be pumpkin\u00a0flavor. The reality was that it tasted like a strangely bitter sugar sweetener with maybe a hint of cinnamon. We were all quite unimpressed with the drinks unassuming appearance and lackluster taste. It was a decent latte, but a poor pumpkin drink.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16961221_bc47b73daafaf6251d89b8161e01a80b24da3a4c.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-123899 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16961221_bc47b73daafaf6251d89b8161e01a80b24da3a4c.jpeg\" alt=\"new-piktochart_16961221_bc47b73daafaf6251d89b8161e01a80b24da3a4c\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe Pumpkin Chai,\u00a0$4 for a small\u00a0comes in a solid white paper cup and is topped with equally bland and slightly droopy white cream. However, the aromatic scents of cinnamon, chai spices, and pumpkin wafting up from this drink were enough to leave our mouths watering. Taking a sip of this drink was like taking in fall in a mouthful. A wonderful warmth fills each sip, the thick taste of cinnamon creating the picture the warm fireplaces and changing leaves hued in a kaleidoscope of color. However, there was still a slight bitterness from the artificial pumpkin that accompanied the warm aftertaste of this drink that kept us from enjoying it fully.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16961404_06e42013541a35e79d2eb78eb0ff77db29a44603.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-123901 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_16961404_06e42013541a35e79d2eb78eb0ff77db29a44603.jpeg\" alt=\"new-piktochart_16961404_06e42013541a35e79d2eb78eb0ff77db29a44603\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe Pumpkin Mocha $4 was an elegant ensemble of fluffy whipped cream topped with a colorful sprinkling of cinnamon and chocolate powder. It was by far the most creative presentation of the four new drinks on the fall menu. We were all quite skeptical of a pumpkin-chocolate combination, but the two flavors combined surprisingly well. The thick coffee accentuated the flavoring of dark chocolate and the small accents of pumpkin were pleasant and subtle, however, not overpowered by the coffee and chocolate flavoring. With fun presentation and the unusual flavor combination, it felt like the perfect drink to order as a festive fall treat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_172_d3b99e9882cac3ed669182be65c95f72fd230b60.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-123902 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/new-piktochart_172_d3b99e9882cac3ed669182be65c95f72fd230b60.jpeg\" alt=\"new-piktochart_172_d3b99e9882cac3ed669182be65c95f72fd230b60\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pumpkin Javiva ($4 for a small), was a decadent swirling of toppling whipped cream served in a clear plastic cup revealing the drinks frothy caramel coloring. With each sip, you were overwhelmed by a fury of cinnamon, pumpkin and sugar. The taste was a perfect match for the desired seasonal flavoring, but after the third or fourth sip, the drink grew too sweet for our tastes. However, if in the mood for a Javiva, we consider this the perfect option. The pumpkin and cinnamon tones in this drink make it a great option for an autumn drink.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pumpkin Chai, with its rich cinnamon flavoring and comforting warmth, came out as a clear winner in terms of how authentically \u201cfall\u201d it was. However, in terms of taste and a fun presentation, we would recommend the Pumpkin Mocha, an unusual match of flavorings to spice up these increasingly chilly weeks. Overall, even if you are a more traditional coffee drinker, we still recommend giving these drinks a try. Although pumpkin spice did not totally live up to its legendary hype, these drinks are great for the occasional treat and a fun way to get into the autumn spirit. <\/span>","excerpt":"It's safe to say fall has truly begun.

If you aren\u2019t confident enough rollerblading around campus, we recommend you stick to a scooter. Make sure to blast those 90s jams all day around campus, preferably with an oversized boombox. If thats not your style, you can also sport a pair of headphones around your neck. We expect to hear NSYNC, Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears all day long. Don't forget to break out it\u2019s also time to break out your colorful windbreakers, scrunchies, chokers, denim overalls and good ol' Chuck Taylor's.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nTuesday: Dressing day - Caesar\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One word: Togas.

Senior citizens day is by far the most anticipated theme of generations day. It's time to dress up as that 70-year-old grandma and grandpa you've been waiting to be since freshmen year. Grab a cane, walker or wheelchair and make sure to dye your hair a nice wispy grey. We expect to see tons of pillows attached to your rear end and lipstick smudged all over your face.

You faltered on the float and dance, which ultimately was the reason you came in third place. However, you killed it during the rallies. If you \u00a0are able to improve on your float and dance from last year and replicate your success at the rallies, the Class of 2018 could be a large threat to the seniors.<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monday: Theme day - Boxers<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s time for the Class of 2018 to enter the Spirit Week ring for the third time. Following last year's Spirit Week, this year\u2019s juniors are expected to impress. Grab your white undershirts, robes, boxing gloves and title belts, and knock this week out. Along with this, girls can sport those boxing braids you\u2019ve been dying to wear. Boxing gloves can be expensive, but are available on Amazon and eBay. You can also wrap your hands with athletic tape or pre-wrap as a less expensive substitute to the gloves.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_123988\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"351\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_9249.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-123988\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_9249.jpg\" alt=\"Staff Writers Kasra Orumchian and Isabella Marcus wear their tropical clothing for the Junior spirit day &quot;Thousand Island&quot;.\" width=\"351\" height=\"234\" \/><\/a> Staff Writers Kasra Orumchian and Isabella Marcus wear their tropical clothing for the Junior spirit day \"Thousand Island\". Photo by Sherwin Amsbaugh[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTuesday: Dressing day - Thousand Island\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s time for the juniors to run this beach one more time. Go all out with leis, coconut bras, hula skirts, bathing suits \u00a0and Tommy Bahama shirts. Amazon, Target, Goodwill, Dollar Stores and Walmart should be able to provide you with those key outfits you are looking so dearly for. This day is the perfect opportunity to bring an assortment of pool floaties to the quad. You should be able to reuse some of that lifeguard material, and must bring that hawaiian spirit. <\/span>\r\n\r\nWednesday: Night rally - Yellow\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the night rally, this is the easiest and by far the most vibrant color to wear for a night time event. Yellow hats, class t-shirts, yellow socks and shorts and whatever yellow you can find will look great next to the green and red classes around you. Amazon should be able to provide all forms of yellow attire, and any glow sticks or neon you seek. Target, Goodwill and Walmart may also have good options for you if you need to find anything else yellow.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThursday: Generations day - Sophisticates\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s time to dress for success. Ladies, grab those pencil skirts, white blouses, blazers and heels if you\u2019re feeling daring. Gentlemen make sure to rock those suits and ties. The perfect accessories for everyone and anyone includes briefcases, a bluetooth earpiece, a coffee mug and glasses. You can borrow your suits and various sophisticate items from your parents, or can buy your own off Amazon.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nFriday: Paly - Green and White\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juniors, it's your last time wearing your Paly gear on the last day of Spirit Week. Make it a memorable final run-through grab your Paly T-shirts, sweatshirts, hats, socks, underwear, gloves, pants and any other Paly gear you have. Viking Helmets, and green and white face paint never disappoint, and there\u2019s no excuse why you should disappoint either. Hit the field after school to watch the official unveiling of your float and Spirit Dance to the rest of the classes, as Spirit Week comes to a close.<\/span>","excerpt":"Spirit Week is by far the best week of the year at Palo Alto High School.

You guys left your mark on the other classes last year, as one of the best freshman classes we\u2019ve ever seen at Paly. Although you fell to last place, expectations are high for you to perform this year.<\/span><\/em>\r\n\r\nMonday: Theme day - Firefighters\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When things get L17 , it\u2019s time for the firefighters to come and extinguish those flames. Bring your A-game and rock those firefighter hats, boots, jackets and suspenders. For a more affordable option, throw on a plain white shirt and some black bottoms paired with red suspenders and firefighter hat.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_123971\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"347\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_9184.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-123971\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_9184.jpg\" alt=\"Staff Writers Kasra Orumchian and Isabella Marcus wear their flannels in preparation to &quot;Ranch&quot; day.\" width=\"347\" height=\"231\" \/><\/a> Staff Writers Kasra Orumchian and Isabella Marcus rock\u00a0their flannels in to demostrate what to wear for\u00a0\"Ranch\" day.

Grab your flannels, cowboy hats, and ride the rodeo. Carrots may go well with ranch dressing, but on this day, put on a bandanna or\u00a0any other assorted cowboy apparel. Bandannas should be rather accessible to anyone; you can borrow them from a friend, or go out and buy them from most retail stores. Almost everything for this day can be found on Amazon, Target and Walmart and should supply you with what you need.<\/span>\r\n\r\nWednesday: Night rally - Red\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s time for the night rally. The class of 2019 impressed at every rally last year and is expected to do the same this year. Sophomores, grab your red and take to the bleachers for the second ever night rally in Paly history. Red might be a hard color to light the night with, but we\u2019re confident that you can do it. Try getting some red neon glow sticks and wear them as necklaces or bracelets. Amazon has a wide and reliable variety of neon material that you can get for a moderately low price.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThursday: Generations day - Teenyboppers\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teenybopper day is commonly known as\u00a0\u201cgreasers day,\u201d so grab your bluetooth speakers and jam out to the soundtrack of \u201cGrease\". If you want to leave a lasting impression on the other classes, earn the hand jive to show your greaser spirit. Stay golden, Ponyboy. For boys, you want to embody the greaser spirit, so slick back your hair, grab your leather jackets and show off that teenage angst. Girls, it\u2019s time to live out your life goals of being Sandy from\u00a0\u201cGrease.\u201d Grab a traditional poodle skirt and pair it with a \u201cpink ladies\u201d jacket or take the alternate approach and rock those pin-up curls, red lipstick and leather jackets. <\/span>\r\n\r\nFriday: Paly - Green and White\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomores, you've done this before, and should know how to do it again. Grab your Paly T-shirts, sweatshirts, hats, socks, underwear, gloves, pants and any other Paly gear you have. Viking Helmets and green and white face paint never disappoint, so there\u2019s no excuse why you should disappoint either. Hit the field after school to watch the official unveiling of the\u00a0floats and Spirit Dances to the rest of the classes as Spirit Week comes to a close.<\/span>","excerpt":"Spirit Week is by far the best week of the year at Palo Alto High School.
