[\/caption]\r\nThe Palo Alto High School baseball team (23-5-1, 12-2) defeated the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (20-12, 13-1), 3-2, thanks to a three-run rally in the final inning of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League championship game on Friday at Los Gatos.\r\n\r\nSophomore starting pitcher Jeremy Akioka held the Wildcats to just one run in five and one-third innings pitched, giving up his lone run in the third inning. Akioka said the team stayed strong despite trailing for most of the game.\r\n\r\n\"Our team did a great job of battling from behind and getting the hits when it mattered,\" Akioka said.\r\n\r\nDown 2-0, the Vikings were unable to score off Los Gatos' starting ace until the seventh and final inning where they sparked a three run rally.\r\n\r\nThis unlikely comeback started with a walk of senior Justin Hull, followed by a deep double off the right field wall by sophomore second baseman Max Jung-Goldberg. A pair of singles by seniors Alec Olmstead and Lawrence Han scored both Hull and Jung-Goldberg.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings finally took the lead off of a beautiful bunt by junior pinch-hitter Michael Champagne, which scored Olmstead from third.\r\n\r\nChampagne said the Vikings defense, specifically their pitching, enabled the offense to make a comeback late in the game and hopes the team can carry its momentum into the Central Coast Section playoffs.  \r\n\r\n\"Our pitching helped keep us in the game and we finally came alive in the 7th and had a great rally to take the lead,\" Champagne said. \"Niko Lillios provided a clutch closing inning to seal the victory. If our team can bottle that intensity we hope to have a far run in CCS.\"\r\n\r\nSophomore relief pitcher Niko Lillios sealed the game by forcing two flyouts and a strikeout.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will move on to compete in the CCS playoffs in the coming weeks The game time, opponent, and location have not yet been decided.\r\n\r\nAccording to Akioka, the team looks to continue its hot streak into the next round.\r\n\r\n\"We're confident that we will be able to use our momentum to push far through CCS this year,\" Akioka said.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School baseball team (23-5-1, 12-2) defeated the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (20-12, 13-1) 3-2, thanks to a three-run rally in the final inning of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League championship game on Friday at Los Gatos.","date":"2016-05-15 19:40:38","author":"Noah Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SCVAL-champs.jpg","categories":["Baseball","Sports","Spotlight","Uncategorized"],"tags":["Baseball","CCS","gatos","Jung-Goldberg","Lillios","niko","palo alto","rally","schoeben","scval","viking","win"]},{"id":119263,"title":"Coffee Chats: English teacher Mimi Park","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/12\/coffee-chats-english-teacher-mimi-park\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_119592\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"439\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13081997_1018696691539752_124260599_n.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-119592\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13081997_1018696691539752_124260599_n.jpg\" alt=\"English and Humanities teacher Mimi Park sits at her desk with an iced latte while discussing her career change. \" width=\"439\" height=\"439\" \/><\/a> English and Humanities teacher Mimi Park sits at her desk with an iced latte while discussing her transition from wanting to be a lawyer to becoming a teacher.

She teaches English 9 and English 9A, as well as Humanities. While Park loves teaching high school English, teaching was not her first passion.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI graduated from law school, but when I left law school I decided I really didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer,\u201d Park said. \u201cI really loved English, which was my major, but when I spoke with my professors a few years later and said 'I\u2019m thinking about becoming a professor,' they were like \u2018Don\u2019t do it! If you want to teach, go to public school, because there are no jobs in the humanities Ph.D. market.\u2019\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Park took her professor\u2019s advice and started looking at programs that would give her a teaching credential. She decided she wanted to move to California\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and ended up going to Stanford University's teacher education program.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen I started looking for jobs there was an opening here at Paly. It was part time and I was like, 'I can't do that because I have to pay rent,'\" Park said. \"Incredibly fortuitously, a teacher soon after took a leave for a year and there were enough classes open that I could get nearly a full-time position. I was hired at Paly and have been here for the past four years.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Park explains that one of the major differences between being a lawyer and teaching high schoolers is who you are working for.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was thinking of doing corporate law and my clients would have been gigantic corporations,\" Park said. \"I was so used to thinking about adults as my clients, and as a teacher, I had to readjust my thinking and start being more aware of the different issues surrounding public education, from the legal issues to policy to even the social-emotional aspects of the students.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the difficult transition from lawyer to high school teacher, Park says that being open to changing careers taught her how to relate to Paly students.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI would say my biggest piece of advice is don't pigeonhole yourself; be open to changing your path or looking for new opportunities, and don\u2019t be afraid to embrace them because it is really easy to get into the mindset of 'this is what I'm going to do and this is what I'm going to be,'\u201d Park said.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nPark recalls having spent all of her\u00a0high school and college\u00a0years preparing for pre-law. However, when she achieved her goal, she realized that being a lawyer just wasn't for her.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI planned to be a lawyer since 8th grade\u00a0when people told me I talk too much and therefore I should be a lawyer,\" Park said. \"It was the scariest and biggest decision I've probably made in my life so far, to give up three years of education and a lot of money and not have a plan,\" Park said. \"I had a year where I had to think about what I wanted to do. It's terrifying, but I think that being really open to that is a super important thing.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Park switching to teaching was the best decision she's ever made.\r\n\r\n\"I love teaching, and I\u2019m fortunate to be in a career when I\u2019m actually excited about coming to work and happy about the work I do, versus dreading the day ahead,\" Park said.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with English and Humanities teacher Mimi Park over an iced latte to discuss her transition from prospective lawyer to teacher, and her advice for Paly students.","date":"2016-05-12 21:08:12","author":"Daniella Maydan","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/13081997_1018696691539752_124260599_n.jpg","categories":["Coffee chats","Features"],"tags":["coffeechats","english","Humanities","mimi park","palo alto","paly"]},{"id":120425,"title":"Liveblog: Baseball vs. Los Gatos in SCVAL elimination game","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/05\/12\/liveblog-baseball-vs-los-gatos-in-scval-elimination-game\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_120116\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/baseball-beats-los-altos.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/baseball-beats-los-altos.jpg\" alt=\"Senior pitcher Alec Olmstead warms up with Senior catcher Lawrence Han before a regular season game against Los Gatos High School.

Lines are drawn quickly as Iron Man voices his support for the plan, along with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). Captain America is against the plan and refuses to obey them, putting him and Iron Man on opposing sides.\r\n\r\nDespite all this, the plan proposed by Ross is not the main source of conflict. This instead comes from the reappearance of the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), and the introduction of a mysterious villain Helmut Zemo, (Daniel Bruhl). It is the lengths that Captain America goes to protect his friend, and the loyalty that he has towards him that drives the conflict and results in quite possibly the most spectacular battle scene in the Marvel franchise, bringing together all of the Avengers and some extras as Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) all choose sides and fight.\r\n\r\nWhere the movie falls flat, however, is the main underlying story. Captain America and Iron Man are friends, then they fight, but then they become friends again? Wait, no, they're fighting again. The final fight between the two just feels too forced; there isn't really a rational reason behind it. In addition, the main villain, Zemo, doesn't seem to convey a serious threat. His motives are clear, but his plan is simply too convoluted. He does however participate in a nice little twist that breaks away from the standard Marvel formula. Despite this Zemo simply isn't given enough room to work a screen, creating a flimsy antagonist, a problem that Marvel movies have been repeating, with the exception of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in \"The Avengers.\" \r\n\r\nOne of the best parts of the movie is the addition of Spider-Man, who makes his debut in the Marvel cinematic universe. With Sony's release of the Spider-Man license, Marvel is now able to use the character in future movies. Holland nails the role of a teen superhero, with all the quips and jokes that the superhero is supposed to have. He is the first movie version of Spider-Man that actually feels and acts like a kid. Despite only appearing in the movie for a brief moment, he absolutely steals the spotlight, overshadowing the introduction of another key Marvel character, Black Panther. Nonetheless, Black Panther is a welcome addition to the movie and has a solid subplot to the overall story.\r\n\r\nWhile not on the same level as \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\", \"Civil War\" manages to deliver a solid package. The introduction of new characters (Spider-Man!) and some incredible fight scenes more than make up for a shaky plot. If you enjoy any Marvel movie, do yourself a favor and go see this one.\r\n\r\n<strong> Captain America: Civil War\r\n2 hours 27 minutes\r\nRated PG-13\r\nDirected by Joe and Anthony Russo\r\nStarring Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan<\/strong>\r\n","excerpt":" Based off of a Marvel comic of the same name, \"Civil War\" revolves around the the growing rift between Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans).
