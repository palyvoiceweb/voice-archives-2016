Girls' are currently ranked 30th in the nation, and 12th in state according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/high-schools\/palo-alto-vikings-(palo-alto,ca)\/girls-soccer-winter\/home.htm\" target=\"_blank\">MaxPreps<\/a>.\r\n\r\nSeedman emphasizes the team's ability to play through adversity, due to the loss of senior left back Jacey Pederson the past few games to a national team camp.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis week was very tough for us not only because we had three games, but we were missing our best player [Pederson],\u201d Seedman said. \u201cWe were also playing three tough opponents with two games on the road but the girls held up well and won them all.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the season comes to a close, seniors\u00a0Heidi Moeser, Jacey Pederson, Nika Woodfill, Alison Lu, Linnea Carlstrom, and Ansley Queen look forward to\u00a0ending the season on a strong note but also to prepare the team for next season as many key players are leaving for college.\r\n\r\nSenior Captain Heidi Moeser remarks on how the team has added multiple new players.\r\n\r\n\"We added 6 new players this year and they are doing an excellent job, and are really a huge part of this team,\" Moeser said. \"With so many of us leaving next year, I still feel confident in the strength of our team. We've proved drastically what we can do and we look to improve every practice, every game.\"\r\n\r\nGiven the success of the Vikings, senior defender Alison Lu stresses the importance of not allowing the wins to stifle improvement.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have been playing well but there are definitely things we can work on,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThere are still some communication issues on the field and we need to work on keeping possession. Improving that will really help us out. We also know the rising seniors and juniors are strong and will uphold what we've accomplished this season so far.\u201d\r\n\r\nMidfielder Emily Tomz compares this season to the last, emphasizing how they have improved.\r\n\r\n\"Compared to last season, I definitely think we have a greater chance at winning leagues and CCS,\" Tomz said. \"We are a really strong and talented group, with a firm defense, crafty midfielders, and fast forwards who score often and with precision. This year more than last year we have been doing more fitness, which has and will benefit us in games, helping us keep up a high endurance the whole game.\"\r\n\r\nAs the second half of the season approaches, the Vikings continues to stay optimistic about the teams ability to maintain its undefeated record, and constantly looks to improve.\r\n\r\n\"For the rest of this season we are definitely aiming to continue our undefeated streak, and, of course, beat mountain view next Friday,\" Tomz said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will face off against league rivals Mountain View (13-0-1, 6-0-1) on Friday at 3:30 p.m. at Paly.","excerpt":"After an impressive start to the season, the Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 soccer team (12-0-1, 7-0-1) continues to dominate opponents with stellar offense and defense maintaining their undefeated record.\r\n","date":"2016-02-05 10:40:21","author":"Ethan Kao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Homestead-vs-PALY.png","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["CCS","dominate","girls","girls soccer","moeser","pederson","seedman","Soccer","undefeated","vikings"]},{"id":115733,"title":"New clubs debut at Club Day Two","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/04\/new-clubs-debut-at-club-day-two\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body will host its second Club Day of the school year\u00a0at lunch tomorrow on the Quad.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event provides an opportunity for new clubs to gain publicity, and gives a chance for both new and old clubs to recruit members.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"_5yl5\">\"Club Day [Two] is a really great way for people to join clubs that\u00a0weren't originally chartered first semester,\" ASB Vice President\u00a0Anmol Nagar said. \"Clubs from first semester are also able to advertise their club.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nagar, unlike Club Day One, this Club Day will run on a regular B schedule and will feature a smaller number of clubs.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThis semester, ASB added nine new clubs: Neuroscience Club, Tapout Club, Beat Club, Polynesian Club, Curling Club, Science Research Club, Unity Club, Disney Club and PALY Teams Club.\u00a0D<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uring the fall of 2015, there were a total of 75 clubs on campus, according to the Paly ASB <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/pahsasb\/clubs\">website<\/a>.\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Paly Voice spoke with\u00a0five\u00a0club founders to learn\u00a0more about their clubs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"overflow-y: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/magic.piktochart.com\/embed\/10782689-club-day-2\" width=\"620\" height=\"3488\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The Associated Student Body will host its second Club Day of the school year at lunch tomorrow on the Quad.","date":"2016-02-04 22:09:56","author":"Annika Behal","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/0000\/00\/DSC_0226_0.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["ASB","Beat Club","club day","clubs","Curling Club","Disney Club","lunch","nagar","Neuroscience Club","Paly TEAM Club","Polynesian Club","quad","Science Research Club","Tapout Club","unity club"]},{"id":115628,"title":"Stanford Blood Center in urgent need of donations","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/04\/stanford-blood-center-in-urgent-need-of-donations\/","content":"Stanford Blood Center is encouraging Palo Alto High School students who are 16 years or older to donate their blood to prepare for the unexpected, as an influx of visitors is coming to the Bay Area for the Super Bowl on Sunday in Santa Clara.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Super Bowl 50 just around the corner, an estimated <a href=\"http:\/\/ww2.kqed.org\/news\/2016\/01\/22\/how-to-get-around-the-bay-area-during-super-bowl-50\">one million people<\/a> are <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/02\/school-gears-up-for-super-bowl-traffic\/\">expected to visit the Bay Area<\/a>, according to KQED News.

Photo: Stanford Blood Center.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The blood center is in critical need of donations as it is currently short on blood inventory. According to Magana, the b<\/span>lood center often experiences a shortage in donations during the winter season because many regular donors are sick with colds or the flu. In addition, recent medical procedures have used up a significant amount of blood, making the blood center's shortage even worse. Magana explains that while the blood center is in dire need of -AB, -B and -O blood donations, all blood types are needed and welcomed.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it takes up to three days after donation to get blood ready for transfusion, it is imperative that people donate their blood soon in order for it to be ready in time for the Super Bowl, according to Magana.<\/span>\r\n\r\nJunior Sophie Pedersen encourages all eligible Paly students to donate their blood.\r\n\r\n\"The reason I want to donate blood is that it just seems like an easy way to help people and I think I have the blood type the donation center is looking for,\" Pedersen said. \"I would encourage anybody who has the time to do it because [the blood center] is experiencing a blood shortage.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Magana, donations take approximately one hour, and students who wish to donate must be at least 16 years old with parental consent or 17 years old or older without parental consent.

Leading the second place team, Homestead, in league by seven points has given the team a high guarantee of winning the league, a clear goal for the team. According to head coach Don Briggs, Paly has not won two consecutive league contests, so a league win to follow last year\u2019s success would be monumental for the team.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn at least the last seven years, we haven\u2019t won two consecutive league contests,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to win league here. It\u2019s hard to even just stay up in the De Anza League sometimes, as it\u2019s very competitive.

That [two goals from Los Gatos High School and Homestead each] is four goals in the last two games, and we\u2019ve given up six goals in the whole [league] season. That\u2019s an issue. That\u2019s not a trend we want, and a lot of that [comes from] a lack of focus.\u201d\r\n\r\nWinning league this year would favor the Vikings in seeding for the Central Coast Section playoffs, which would allow them to face less difficult competition early on, according to junior captain and center defender Neil Verwillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s great as far as CCS seeding goes, as that would pretty much guarantee us a top three spot and would give us an easier run in CCS,\u201d Verwillow said. \u201cLast year, I know that they had a tough run in CCS as they played Bellarmine [College Preparatory] pretty early on and Bellarmine is tough competition, but I think this year will be better.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly will face off Mountain View High School (7-4-5, 3-3-2) at 3:30 p.m. Friday at Mountain View.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 soccer team (12-0-3, 7-0-2) continues to remain undefeated in its De Anza League season and leads its league division with 21 points, over second place Homestead High School (7-2-7, 3-1-4) with 13 points.","date":"2016-02-04 10:40:38","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_80871.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["Bellarmine","boys soccer","don briggs","eli friedlander","gunn titans","homestead high school","los gatos high school","neil verwillow","palo alto high school","Soccer","sports"]},{"id":115677,"title":"ASB announces joint Gunn-Paly dance details","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/03\/asb-announces-joint-gunn-paly-dance-details\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Palo Alto and Gunn high school student governments\u00a0released more information about the\u00a0combined Gunn-Paly dance on Feb. 26 at the Mitchell Park Community Center in a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/V4bEf3TQLuI\">promotional video<\/a>.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dance\u2019s official theme is \u201cHighlight of the Night,\u201d and students should dress casually in all-white with elements of neon, said organizers, who will also provide body paint to color clothing.\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Paly junior\u00a0Social Commissioner Maryland Valdez-Gonzalez, student officers hope to bolster unity between the schools.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBoth the Paly and Gunn student bodies decided to create and combine a dance ... for the purpose of creating a stronger bond between both high schools in the Palo Alto community,\u201d Valdez-Gonzalez said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly's Associated Student Body and Gunn's Student Executive Council\u00a0first began developing combined dance plans in November and December, according to Gunn Dance Commissioner Radhika Ranganathan.

According to Martien,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">these flights do not have a large environmental impact on the Bay Area.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial aircrafts do contribute to the Bay Area's inventory of air pollution emissions for compounds that have direct health impacts, but compared to the region's total, they are not a major source,\u201d Martien said. \u201cBecause the jet flights are above the immediate layer of air where people live and breathe, the direct impact of these flights and changes to flight paths won't have a big impact on air quality.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nIn addition, Martien says that the Bay Area\u2019s air quality is good compared to other urban American cities, and is improving.\r\n\r\nOur\u00a0air may not appear to be greatly affected by NextGen's redirected flights, but the City of Palo Alto should study the long-term effects of airborne transportation on the environment.\r\n\r\n\"I would say that even if the impact on air quality is not a 'big impact' ...\u00a0it is still an impact\u00a0\u00a0and I would like our air quality analyzed in the most up to date way possible,\" Sky Posse co-leader Rachel Kellerman said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_114501\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"403\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/air-traffic-control-baytracon-sfo.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-114501\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/air-traffic-control-baytracon-sfo.jpg\" alt=\"air-traffic-control-baytracon-sfo\" width=\"403\" height=\"307\" \/><\/a> Increased air traffic above the Bay Area has led to numerous noise complaints since early 2014. Sky Posse co-leader Jennifer Landesmann says she hopes to work with the FAA to redesign Bay Area airplane routes. \"We need the FAA ... to give us some immediate relief,\" Landessman said. Photo\u00a0courtesy of\u00a0SFO Noise Abatement Office.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite little cause for alarm with regards to air quality, Sky Posse is correct that\u00a0resulting sound pollution is an issue.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey [new flight routes] could have significant impacts on noise levels,\" Martien said. \"And noise itself can have health impacts.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The airplane noise itself is not generally bothersome compared to other forms of transportation in Palo Alto. After all, over 25 trains pass parallel to Palo Alto High School each day, and its cacophonous horns are far more likely to disturb my daily life than a plane thousands of feet in the air. In addition, Palo Alto\u2019s population nearly <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2010\/02\/02\/palo-alto-neighborhoods\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">triples <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">each day due to commuters entering and leaving for work. The resulting traffic, from buses to honking cars, largely outweighs any noise pollution from planes.<\/span>\r\n\r\nHowever, some residents claim the planes\u2019 noise has negatively impacted their overall well-being.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don\u2019t mind complaining. I just mind the planes and the noise,\u201d one woman at a Sky Posse meeting said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nLow-flying planes may be irritating to some Palo Altans, but this newfound noise is only the tip of the iceberg.\u00a0If we\u00a0wish to limit noise pollution, we should not restrict ourselves to focusing solely on that of airplanes. Traffic congestion and trains\u2019 blaring horns are issues that are just as important to address. If we want a happier and quieter community, collaborating with both the FAA and local city councils is a vital step on limiting all unneeded noise, regardless of the source.","excerpt":"New flight routes above Palo Alto have limited environmental effects and only represent the tip of the iceberg of Bay Area noise pollution.","date":"2016-02-03 16:07:17","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/air-traffic-control-baytracon-sfo.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["airplane noise","annoying","association","aviation","Bay Area","environment","faa","federal","martien","nextgen","noise","palo alto","paly","peninsula","phil","plane","pollution","sky posse","transportation"]},{"id":114947,"title":"Girls&#8217; soccer dominates Homestead","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/02\/girls-soccer-dominates-homestead\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115393\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/GIRLS-SOCCER-Season-recap.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-115393\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/GIRLS-SOCCER-Season-recap.png\" alt=\"Senior Alison Lu cuts past Homestead defense after shutting down a goal attempt by Homestead sophomore holding mid Laura Salvaggio.

Seemingly in a continuous streak of back-to-back goals the Paly girls' went on to score a second goal 15 minutes in by Junior defender Talia Malchin and a third and fourth goal, both by Woodfill, within the first 35 minutes. By the 36 minute mark Alison Lu finished with the fifth goal, setting the score to an impressive 5-0.\r\n\r\n\"We have been really successful so far this year, our defense is phenomenal\" Tomz said in an interview following the match. \"Our team communication on the field has been pretty good this season, and has greatly improved by being positive and motivational. A lot of that is because of our captains, Jacey Pederson and Heidi Moeser, who are extremely nice, funny and bring the team together on and off the field.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Captain Moeser described some initial difficulty given the team already had two games previously in the week, leaving little energy for the Friday match.\r\n\r\n\"We came off two games this week, so it was initially difficult given we were so tired, but we really battled and stayed strong,\" Moeser said. \"I would say this was one of our better games, and morale is high given our undefeated status.\"\r\n\r\nHomestead players,junior forward Christina Klariss and sophomore left-mid Laura Salvaggio shared their thoughts on their teams performance during the match.\r\n\r\n\"Palo Alto is a really good team, and it was difficult to keep up with their speed,\" said Klariss, \"We've hadn't played our best the first half and Palo Alto definitely took advantage of that, but for the second half we really showed what we are capable of. Paly didn't score on us in the second half at all, and I think that really demonstrated how we can rise above a previously negative situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"We came into the game preparing for defeat,\" said Salvaggio. \"But we still kept in mind that we needed to prove our skill, which we really did during the second half.\"\r\n\r\nThe Paly girls' will have their next match at 3:30pm this coming Wednesday at Milpitas.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School girls' soccer defeats Homestead Mustangs 5-0, continuing undefeated streak.","date":"2016-02-02 22:37:42","author":"Bianca Al-Shamari","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-09-at-8.58.40-PM.png","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["girls soccer","heidi moeser","homestead","paly","Soccer"]},{"id":115403,"title":"Preview: Boys&#8217; basketball to take on Milpitas tomorrow","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/02\/preview-boys-basketball-to-take-on-milpitas-tomorrow\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115475\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_58031-1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-115475\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_58031-1.jpg\" alt=\"Junior guard Miles Tention rises up to take a outside three in the third quarter against Gunn High School at Gunn.

Junior guard Jack Simison believes that the key for success against Milpitas is the team's energy.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings have five games left in their regular season and are currently sitting in fifth place in the De Anza League. The Vikings should make it to playoffs as long as they win one of the five games left this season.\r\n\r\n\"We are on a four-league-game losing streak and we seriously need to turn that around,\" Simison said. \"We need to be able to play unselfishly and as a team.\"\r\n\r\nMilpitas is coming off of a 57-38 loss to Fremont High School.\r\n\r\nSimison says that the Vikings have the upper edge, but still believes Milpitas has a chance.\r\n\r\n\"We've beaten them before so we should have the upper hand when it comes to confidence,\" Simison said. \"We just need to come out strong and carry that throughout the game.

Zachary Perron of the Palo Alto Police Department, law enforcement has extended police officers' hours and is working in conjunction with other agencies to deal with the influx of visitors.\r\n\r\n\"We\u2019ve moved all field personnel to 12-hour shifts this week, as opposed to their normal 11-hour shifts,\" Perron said. \"They\u2019ll be supplemented by our SWAT team personnel and downtown officers. Other personnel will be on standby if needed, but at this point, we don\u2019t anticipate any problems.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout this week, the Paly parking lots are being monitored due to predicted congestion, as the\u00a0Denver Broncos, one of the teams competing in the Super Bowl, are practicing\u00a0at Stanford University. According to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson, the school has anticipated increased traffic around the Palo Alto area and possible attempts to gain access to parking space in the Paly and Palo Alto Unified School District office parking lots.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause the Denver Broncos are practicing at Stanford, there\u2019s probably going to be a lot of people here,\u201d Berkson said.\r\n\r\nTo combat this, the PAUSD has hired security personnel to monitor cars entering parking lots from Monday through Friday, according to Berkson.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo prevent them [non-Paly students, faculty and visitors] from parking in our lots and prevent riff raff, hopefully, from coming through, the district has hired security at all the entrances to all the lots,\u201d Berkson said. \u201cThey will be here just for the week, through Friday. They are making sure people have parking permits.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Berkson, the security\u2019s presence should not affect students, staff or parents dropping off or picking up students.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that they [security personnel] use enough common sense [to tell] that between 7:45 [a.m.] to 8:15 [a.m.] that that\u2019s probably people dropping off their kids,\u201d Berkson said. \u201cIf someone drives in wearing a Broncos beanie and jersey, those are the people that are probably not dropping off their kids. This should not affect students.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the effort to avoid traffic, these measures have made entrance into the Paly parking lots much more time-consuming, according to senior Kelly Branson.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere's more traffic,\u201d Branson said. \u201cToday there was a ton of traffic because we [the cars] couldn't get in [to the lots] as fast, so I was 15 minutes late to class.\u201d","excerpt":"In anticipation of increased traffic due to Super Bowl 50 this Sunday at Levi Stadium in Santa Clara, local law enforcement and the Palo Alto High School administration will be taking additional measures to ensure public safety.
