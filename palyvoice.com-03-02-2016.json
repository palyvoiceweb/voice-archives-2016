Seemingly in a continuous streak of back-to-back goals the Paly girls' went on to score a second goal 15 minutes in by Junior defender Talia Malchin and a third and fourth goal, both by Woodfill, within the first 35 minutes. By the 36 minute mark Alison Lu finished with the fifth goal, setting the score to an impressive 5-0.\r\n\r\n\"We have been really successful so far this year, our defense is phenomenal\" Tomz said in an interview following the match. \"Our team communication on the field has been pretty good this season, and has greatly improved by being positive and motivational. A lot of that is because of our captains, Jacey Pederson and Heidi Moeser, who are extremely nice, funny and bring the team together on and off the field.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Captain Moeser described some initial difficulty given the team already had two games previously in the week, leaving little energy for the Friday match.\r\n\r\n\"We came off two games this week, so it was initially difficult given we were so tired, but we really battled and stayed strong,\" Moeser said. \"I would say this was one of our better games, and morale is high given our undefeated status.\"\r\n\r\nHomestead players,junior forward Christina Klariss and sophomore left-mid Laura Salvaggio shared their thoughts on their teams performance during the match.\r\n\r\n\"Palo Alto is a really good team, and it was difficult to keep up with their speed,\" said Klariss, \"We've hadn't played our best the first half and Palo Alto definitely took advantage of that, but for the second half we really showed what we are capable of. Paly didn't score on us in the second half at all, and I think that really demonstrated how we can rise above a previously negative situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"We came into the game preparing for defeat,\" said Salvaggio. \"But we still kept in mind that we needed to prove our skill, which we really did during the second half.\"\r\n\r\nThe Paly girls' will have their next match at 3:30pm this coming Wednesday at Milpitas.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School girls' soccer defeats Homestead Mustangs 5-0, continuing undefeated streak.","date":"2016-02-02 22:37:42","author":"Bianca Al-Shamari","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-09-at-8.58.40-PM.png","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["girls soccer","heidi moeser","homestead","paly","Soccer"]},{"id":115403,"title":"Preview: Boys&#8217; basketball to take on Milpitas tomorrow","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/02\/02\/preview-boys-basketball-to-take-on-milpitas-tomorrow\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_115475\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_58031-1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-115475\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_58031-1.jpg\" alt=\"Junior guard Miles Tention rises up to take a outside three in the third quarter against Gunn High School at Gunn.

Junior guard Jack Simison believes that the key for success against Milpitas is the team's energy.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings have five games left in their regular season and are currently sitting in fifth place in the De Anza League. The Vikings should make it to playoffs as long as they win one of the five games left this season.\r\n\r\n\"We are on a four-league-game losing streak and we seriously need to turn that around,\" Simison said. \"We need to be able to play unselfishly and as a team.\"\r\n\r\nMilpitas is coming off of a 57-38 loss to Fremont High School.\r\n\r\nSimison says that the Vikings have the upper edge, but still believes Milpitas has a chance.\r\n\r\n\"We've beaten them before so we should have the upper hand when it comes to confidence,\" Simison said. \"We just need to come out strong and carry that throughout the game.

Zachary Perron of the Palo Alto Police Department, law enforcement has extended police officers' hours and is working in conjunction with other agencies to deal with the influx of visitors.\r\n\r\n\"We\u2019ve moved all field personnel to 12-hour shifts this week, as opposed to their normal 11-hour shifts,\" Perron said. \"They\u2019ll be supplemented by our SWAT team personnel and downtown officers. Other personnel will be on standby if needed, but at this point, we don\u2019t anticipate any problems.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout this week, the Paly parking lots are being monitored due to predicted congestion, as the\u00a0Denver Broncos, one of the teams competing in the Super Bowl, are practicing\u00a0at Stanford University. According to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson, the school has anticipated increased traffic around the Palo Alto area and possible attempts to gain access to parking space in the Paly and Palo Alto Unified School District office parking lots.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause the Denver Broncos are practicing at Stanford, there\u2019s probably going to be a lot of people here,\u201d Berkson said.\r\n\r\nTo combat this, the PAUSD has hired security personnel to monitor cars entering parking lots from Monday through Friday, according to Berkson.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo prevent them [non-Paly students, faculty and visitors] from parking in our lots and prevent riff raff, hopefully, from coming through, the district has hired security at all the entrances to all the lots,\u201d Berkson said. \u201cThey will be here just for the week, through Friday. They are making sure people have parking permits.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Berkson, the security\u2019s presence should not affect students, staff or parents dropping off or picking up students.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that they [security personnel] use enough common sense [to tell] that between 7:45 [a.m.] to 8:15 [a.m.] that that\u2019s probably people dropping off their kids,\u201d Berkson said. \u201cIf someone drives in wearing a Broncos beanie and jersey, those are the people that are probably not dropping off their kids. This should not affect students.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the effort to avoid traffic, these measures have made entrance into the Paly parking lots much more time-consuming, according to senior Kelly Branson.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere's more traffic,\u201d Branson said. \u201cToday there was a ton of traffic because we [the cars] couldn't get in [to the lots] as fast, so I was 15 minutes late to class.\u201d","excerpt":"In anticipation of increased traffic due to Super Bowl 50 this Sunday at Levi Stadium in Santa Clara, local law enforcement and the Palo Alto High School administration will be taking additional measures to ensure public safety.

Photo by Cooper Lou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWhen over 50 percent of Americans believe that it is \u201cunsafe to eat genetically modified foods,\u201d you would think they would know what genetically modified foods are. Shockingly, they don\u2019t. This is evident by the fact that 70 to 80 percent of U.S. foods are considered to contain GM products in them, and yet 60 percent of Americans think that they have never eaten a GM food before. How is it that so many people are uneducated about a topic they speak so strongly about?\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term GMO often refers to an organism that contains recombinant DNA, meaning an organism that has DNA from other species inserted into their genome. This addition of recombinant DNA can cause a\u00a0modified organism to display new traits and characteristics, which often contribute to the organism\u2019s survival and\/or nutritional value. Some common examples of GM foods are corn, canola oil and soybeans. Despite the high percentage of U.S. foods with GM products in them, the general public remains wary of them, largely because of false advertising, misinterpretation of GMO studies and a disconnect between everyday people and scientists.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When biotech crops first hit the market in the late '90s, they were not a major concern to most people, and the topic remained under the radar for many years. What truly brought the public\u2019s attention to GMOs were the sellers of natural foods and organic products, who took advantage of the public\u2019s lack of education about GMOs and began labeling foods as \u201cNon-GMO\u201d in order to scare consumers into buying their organic products. Today, the anti-GMO movement is continuing to grow stronger, with large supermarkets and food distributors such as Trader Joe's and Chipotle swearing off GMOs. These food distributors are incredibly popular among the general public, and their actions have influenced millions of people to blindly reject genetically modified foods. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the general public\u2019s negative views on genetically modified organisms grow stronger, anti-GMO websites are starting to pop up all over the Internet. These sites spread false information and misinterpreted studies, many of which end up going viral and causing the development of concerns about the safety of GMOs. Despite the World Health Organization and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) both declaring GM foods as safe to eat, almost 90 percent of American Association for the Advancement of Science scientists believing GMOs are safe, and hundreds of published studies that back up that conclusion, many people still believe that genetically modified organisms are unsafe for consumption. People point to fraudulent and\/or misinterpreted studies, and claim that Monsanto (an agriculture company that profits from GMOs) is trying to cover up their negative side effects. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One such example of a misinterpreted study is when multiple anti-GMO sites wrote\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/articles.mercola.com\/sites\/articles\/archive\/2011\/10\/06\/dangerous-toxins-from-gmo-foods.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">articles<\/a> that described a 2010 study in which traces of the Bt protein Cry1Ab were found in fetal and maternal blood. At first glance, these results seem alarming, as they seem to imply that GMOs are harming fetuses. However, the articles failed to mention many key points, the most important ones being that<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0there was no proof the Cry1AB protein came from the GM food (Cry1AB is used in \"natural insecticide\" formulations and so the protein could have also come from eating other organic foods), and that mammals lack the receptor for the Cry1Ab protein, meaning that Bt does not affect humans in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> way. Despite the study\u2019s obvious flaws and the fact that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0had already approved Bt potatoes, corn and cotton in 1995, the article went viral and caused an outpouring of public outcry. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hundreds of these types of articles exist, most of which can be completely discredited if the time is taken to dissect them properly. However, most people do not do further research on the scientific articles they read, and so the information spreads throughout the Internet, misinforming thousands of people and causing an irrational fear of GMOs. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no doubt that the issue of GMOs is a complicated one; however, at this moment in time, it is abundantly clear that the GMOs in question have both been determined safe by the FDA and can be used to help millions of people worldwide. For example, \u201cGolden Rice,\u201d rice that has been engineered to contain more Vitamin A, has been shown to help prevent people from going blind due to Vitamin A deficiency, a common occurrence among kids in Southeast Asia. At the time of its invention, even Bill Clinton supported \u201cGolden Rice,\u201d exclaiming: \u201cIf we could get more of this Golden Rice \u2026 out to the develop[ing] world ... It could save 40,000 lives a day.\u201d However, 16 years after the invention that has the potential to save millions of kids\u2019 lives, \"Golden Rice\"\u00a0still is not commercially available due to the ludicrous claims made by big companies. It is evident that genetically modified foods have the potential to help millions of people around the world, yet the public outcry and big business interference has stalled the development of life-saving technology.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may be wondering, \"Why should I care about anti-GMO activists? <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This doesn\u2019t affect me<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d Palo Alto is in the heart of Silicon Valley and is leading the way in scientific and technological advancement.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0It is our job to stay educated on the matter, and to encourage the development of genetically modified organisms. The acceptance of GM foods will take a long time, but it will happen in <\/span>our<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> generation. It is our<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0responsibility to not only hold pro-GMO stances, but to actively promote scientific advancements such as GMOs, so that we create an environment in which life-saving scientific and technological advancements that hold the potential to save millions of lives worldwide, can continue to be developed.<\/span>","excerpt":"When over 50 percent of Americans believe that it is \u201cunsafe to eat genetically modified foods,\" you would think they would know what genetically modified foods are.
