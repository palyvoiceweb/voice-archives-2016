This recently brought them to the Alta tournament in Utah, where both students received \u201cbids\u201d that bring\u00a0them one step closer to a coveted spot in the TOC, a tournament that, according to He, only roughly 100 student debaters participate in. Students receive bids based on their performances in previous tournaments, many of which are out of the area and even out of state. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both students performed exceptionally well in their previous tournament, which Fee credits to their personal connection to their topics.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis debate tournament went pretty well,\u00a0since we both went pretty far,\u201d Fee said. \u201cBut more importantly was both of us writing about ourselves.

Photo: Walt Disney animations.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scene opens with the wide eyes of a small girl as she tumbles through the sand and is playfully teased by a waving tide. It is instantly noticeable, in the warm toned lyrical opening musical number, that Disney has invited us back to its magical world. Like a tide curling back into the sea, we are once again swept up in the world of adventure, friendship and magic. The eyes of the children in the audience grow as wide as baby Moana's, devouring this spectacle of color and sound. The eyes of the adults with them reflect a familiar nostalgia, as new worlds are made familiar through the swish of that magic wand. However, Disney's \u201cMoana\u201d also offers something new: a development in the new age of Disney princesses brought to us in movies like \u201cPrincess and the Frog, \u201cBrave\u201d and \u201cFrozen.\u201d Moana, a Polynesian princess, but also soon-to-be leader of her people, offers a new image to what a hero is meant to be. Through this young protagonist's will and powerful spirit, the movie develops a message of finding power within and believing in yourself unquestionably.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie follows Moana as she embarks on a journey to save the dying island she calls home. \u00a0Throughout her childhood, she is sheltered by her parents and community from \u201cexploring beyond the reef.\u201d \u00a0However, she soon finds out that the sea chose her to return a treasured stone that had been stolen from the motherland by the demigod Maui thousands of years ago to save her island. \u00a0Moana has to journey past the reef and into the dangers of the deep sea to return the stone. \u00a0Along the way, she encounters and defeats many challenges, proving to herself she is worthy of her destiny, as her grandmother told her countless times. She discovers she can do anything she sets out to do no matter what other people say about her. \u00a0\u201cMoana\u201d emphasizes the importance of friendships, nature and community. \u00a0The film also proudly embraces Polynesian culture and traditions. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>The Music<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the Broadway musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d elevates the movie with an incredible soundtrack, full of his classic literary rhythm and hip hop flair. Miranda\u2019s influence is strongly reflected in the character-performed musical numbers, including standouts \u201cHow Far I\u2019ll Go\u201d and \u201cYou're Welcome.\u201d Miranda, along with<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Opetaia Foa'i, the lead singer of the South Pacific fusion band Te Vaka, and Disney composer-arranger Mark Mancina gives Moana a unique sound unlike that of earlier movies. The soundtrack drives the plot and enhances the films ambient surroundings.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_127166\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"375\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/moana-disney-movie.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-127166\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/moana-disney-movie.jpg\" alt=\"moana disney movie\" width=\"375\" height=\"281\" \/><\/a> The character Moana smiles into the sunset. Throughout the movie, Moana follows her heart and embraces her adventurous nature in order to save her family. Photo: Walt Disney animations.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>The Girl\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through Moana\u2019s character, the message of female empowerment and courage comes through as well as the importance of following one's heart. Moana follows her heart and embraces her adventurous nature to save her family. She is courageous and unwilling to compromise what she believes for others. Her goal is to save her island and her people, not to marry a prince. At the end of the movie Moana does not end up with a man and instead saves the island and returns to her family. This is refreshing because it sends a message that Moana did not need a man to validate her victory and that there is more to life than meeting and falling in love with a prince. This powerful female lead is voiced by a 16-year-old <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mililani, Hawaii native, Auli\u2019i Cravalho. Cravalho was discovered by Disney while singing at a charity event in Oahu, Hawaii. Additionally, Moana does not look like princesses from the past. Moana is different in that she has a more realistic body type. She<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0is also physically active throughout the movie, showing off her strength and ability to face dangers. Through Moana\u2019s physical ability, courage, body type and unwillingness to settle for anything less than what she believes in, the movie goes against societal norms of what a woman should be. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>The Characters<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the characters in \u201cMoana\u201d are voiced by famous actors such as former WWE fighter Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Jemaine Clement and Nicole Scherzinger, most of whom have roots in the Pacific Islands. According to<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/hollywood\/2016\/11\/moana-oceanic-trust-disney-controversy-pacific-islanders-polynesia\">\u00a0Vanity Fair<\/a>, the cast, with help of the screenwriter was able to subtly add their experience of Pacific culture into their characters. The voice of Moana herself,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carvalho,\u00a0shines\u00a0throughout the film with natural talent in acting and music. The way that she played Moana made her a relatable character for the audience. Johnson is also a star in the movie. Although Johnson is known for usually acting as tough men in movies, he plays a character who has a soft interior and even breaks into a catchy song in the film.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>The Animation<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graphics and animation in this film are hypnotizing. Immediately from the first second of the film, to the very last, the scenes were filled with bright, vibrant scenes of nature and culture. The characters are incredibly realistic and relatable and the way they were portrayed led to laughter and tears from the audience.\u00a0Because of the film is set in the Polynesian islands, \"Moana\" also required many technological upgrades regarding the animation of water and even hair in order to make it more expressive. \u00a0A lot of research went into developing an authentic cultural atmosphere in the film. According to V<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/hollywood\/2016\/11\/moana-oceanic-trust-disney-controversy-pacific-islanders-polynesia\">anity Fair<\/a>, creators John Musker\u00a0and\u00a0Ron Clements went on various trips to the Polynesian islands before starting on Moana. For all authentic details, they consulted the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/hollywood\/2016\/11\/moana-oceanic-trust-disney-controversy-pacific-islanders-polynesia\">Ocean Trust<\/a>, a group of specialists from the islands, integral in shaping the culturally accurate fine details, such as Maui's hair and accurate lyrics. These advances were extremely effective as the graphics looked incredibly realistic and natural throughout the entire film.<\/span>\r\n\r\nOverall, Moana was a refreshing wave in the Disney princess collection, with endearing characters, an incredible music soundtrack and an empowered female led. It's a movie you won't want to miss.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Walt Disney Animation Studios, famously known for its animated princess movies such as \u201cThe Princess in the Frog,\u201d \u201cCinderella,\u201d and \u201cBrave,\u201d recently came out with yet another inspiring princess movie titled \u201cMoana.\u201d With a beautiful message about female empowerment and cultural appreciation, Disney finally perfected an inspiring princess movie for not only young girls but people of all ages and cultures.","date":"2016-12-13 16:49:56","author":"Emilia Diaz-Magaloni","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Screen-Shot-2016-12-08-at-9.12.17-PM.png","categories":["Entertainment","Reviews","Spotlight"],"tags":["Auli'i Cravalho","disney","Lin Manuel Miranda","Moana","movie","review","voice"]},{"id":127245,"title":"Dear admin: Reduce stress, extend review days","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/12\/dear-admin-reduce-stress-extend-review-days\/","content":"Dear Palo Alto High School Administration,\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This weekend, libraries, coffee shops and caf\u00e9s were flooded\u00a0with sleep-deprived high school students, their heaps of study materials and empty coffee cups engulfing tables and countertops. This is the universal indicator\u00a0that it is that time of year yet again: first semester final exams. It is no secret that the stress of finals places a heavy burden on the already overloaded shoulders of Paly students. Fortunately, you provided us with a precious 140 minutes of review per class on the Friday, Monday and Tuesday before finals. While we appreciate your efforts to reduce the stress on our strained student body, we are running into the same problem that we have with many\u00a0of your endeavors \u2014 it is simply not enough.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_127319\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"366\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/15388804_571942243011801_1270580781_o.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-127319\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/15388804_571942243011801_1270580781_o.jpg\" alt=\"Junior Chloe Iglehart studies diligently at a local Starbucks.

Photo by Maya Reuven.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During these three days of review, teachers are instructed to not\u00a0assign or collect any assignments, theoretically allowing students to have the time to review their seemingly endless pile of notes from the past semester. This is a daunting task, even with the extra time. However, this period is not nearly long enough for a student to study seven classes' worth of semester long material.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As any Paly student has realized, their finals studying must begin far before the school\u2019s allotted review days. Maybe this would be possible if the remainder of the week leading up to finals was\u00a0treated as a normal work week, as one may expect it to be. Instead, however, teachers use this time to wrap up all of their major assignments from the semester, leaving many students with an even more rigorous work load than any given week during the past four months. As a student, it\u2019s hard to worry about your math final in the same week that you have\u00a0two tests, three projects and two presentations.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what is the solution? <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We propose that next semester, you extend our review period\u00a0two extra block periods in total. This would give students that crucial study time necessary to excel in their finals, while only taking away a single class period from teachers, still allowing plenty of time to conclude their semester\u2019s material.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These extra two days of review would significantly decrease the stress of reviewing an entire semester of information in a period of three days. As expected, at the end of the semester, students are swamped\u00a0with last unit tests, projects and presentations that cause an unimaginable amount of stress as it is. Take our friend Marissa Ludwig for example, who had three tests in her hardest classes this week. \"Not only is that the first time I\u2019ve had more than two tests back to back, but it also prohibited me from being able to start studying for finals because I was worried about the unit tests,\" she told us, with exhaustion apparent in her tired eyes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unreasonable to expect that during this time students can begin reviewing independently. Instead, it exponentially increases the\u00a0pressure on them, as they take on the arduous task of cramming 18 weeks' worth of material into a measly\u00a0few days. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We do want to acknowledge the hard work of our teachers to schedule lessons for an immense amount of material in such a short span of time. This is why we believe that expanding our review period\u00a0a mere even \u2014 and \u2014 odd block day is the best\u00a0solution, and the most effective way to ensure that the needs of our student body are being met without shifting that pressure onto our staff. Teachers can certainly find a way to spread out that missing 90 minutes of instructional period throughout the semester. This minor adjustment on their part could make a major difference in our student body wellness, an issue that Paly has struggled with for years.<\/span>\r\n\r\nA second problem\u00a0presents itself for\u00a0classes that do not have final exams. For these teachers, extending the review period creates an array of difficulties, especially when it comes to keeping students engaged. For such classes, we are\u00a0more than willing to compromise. Those teachers\u00a0whose classes do not have a final exam of some sort may continue to assign classwork and homework as per usual, because if there is no special circumstance towards the end of the semester for their course, we see no reason why it\u00a0should not continue normally. However, we urge these instructors to bear in mind the work load that students are faced with in other courses, and make adjustments to their curriculum accordingly. The student body would be\u00a0placing a large amount of trust in these instructors to be flexible, which is critical to the success of this arrangement.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We asked Kathleen\u00a0Laurence, assistant principal of innovation and learning, why this extension\u00a0has not already been put into play. Her response ultimately came down to a\u00a0matter\u00a0of time. \"<\/span>The first semester is shorter than the second semester, so I think it would be difficult to extend it [the review days],\" she told us.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0However, again, we feel that two days is a minor concession, and we believe that many students would be willing to give up a day or two of their summer vacation if it meant having this major stress reliever come winter time. Laurence told us herself, \"That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be opened up for discussion. It just isn\u2019t currently on the [administration's] radar.\" Our hope is that this letter begins the process of opening\u00a0the\u00a0discussion, and sheds a light on an issue that students have been faced with for years.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know that you have done a lot to help decrease the stress of the students, from keeping the library open late, to giving students free dinners, to bringing in therapy dogs and we sincerely appreciate it all. However, when it comes down to it, our peers would reap the most benefits from an extra day of review in each class.
