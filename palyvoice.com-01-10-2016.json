Or will it be \"Game Over\" for everyone?\r\n\r\nWith Spirit Week just around the corner, each Palo Alto High School class is eagerly preparing for the most passionate week of the school year.\r\n\r\nAs always, the freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors will be represented by their class colors: orange, red, yellow and green, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor its last Spirit Week at Paly, the senior Class of 2017 has gone with the theme of \u201cGame Over.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to senior Tanner Newell, the Class of 2017 has the potential to do better than previous years.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think a lot of people are much more engaged this year so we should do better than we\u2019ve ever done before,\u201d Newell said.\r\n\r\nAfter much deliberation, the junior class \u00a0decided on \"boxing\" as its theme. There was a bit of <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/23\/the-problem-with-our-theme-selection-process\/\">controversy<\/a> over choosing boxing as the theme, as the class originally voted for a different idea.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Sabrina Hall, Spirit Week should be about class unity, not infighting.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that the people sort of forgot what Spirit Week is supposed to be about,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt's being united as one grade and all just enjoying this week as a sign of just love for the school and love for the class.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Class of 2019 is coming into Spirit Week with more confidence than last year and is planning to redeem themselves after coming last during their freshman year with the theme of \u201cfirefighters.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the theme is pretty nice,\" sophomore Paul Shand said. \"I think freshmen are going to come last, but I hope we do great.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe freshman class \u00a0will be kicking off its\u00a0first Spirit Week with the theme, \u201cEye of the Tiger.\u201d\r\n\r\nFreshman Sarah O\u2019Riordan is excited for the theme.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe freshman theme is so awesome this year,\u201d O'Riordan said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how everyone looks during Spirit Week.\u201d","excerpt":"Can the firefighting Class of 2019 extinguish the junior fighting spirit?

Read on to\u00a0take an in-depth look at\u00a0the various candidates and their platforms.<\/em>\r\n\r\nMelissa Baten Caswell, a current school board member, is running for her third term.\r\n\r\nCaswell has previously served as board president and has experience serving on various school specific PTA councils.\r\n\r\nAt the school board election forum on Sept. 20 at the Mitchell Park Community center, Caswell said she believes in\u00a0the importance of making sure all Palo Alto Unified School District students are lifelong learners with skills that are relevant in the current and future economy.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have to make sure every single student is engaged in the classroom and supported, in academics and social emotional health,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cPromote life long learners [that are] engaged in their education. We need to be looking at the whole child, looking at every single student.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, Caswell recounted the various improvements and new additions to curriculum that have taken place during her time on the school board. She noted that an area of improvement is allowing teachers to lead these breakthroughs by providing adequate resources and opportunities.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have added flipped classrooms, blended learning, pathways [and] we put in a program with 200 students doing research projects,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI do think one action is to help our teachers with innovative ideas and flushing them out. Give them some time. If we don't give teachers time to focus on innovative ideas they can't do it. Help teachers invest in choice.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nCaswell provided further explanations for her past stance against the opening of a new elementary school by noting the amount of classrooms that aren\u2019t used for core classes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere has been declining enrollment for 5-6 years, it's expensive to have a school,\u201d Caswell said. \u00a0\u201cTwenty six classrooms are not being used as primary classrooms in elementary schools.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She addressed student-teacher ratios by stating that its importance varies based on the type of class and the teaching style of the instructor.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe quality of the teacher preempts everything,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI think it would be a good idea for us to have ranges for class size. When we talk about averages it's across the school or department, I think putting hard caps would be difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caswell highlighted\u00a0that the district\u2019s previous homework policy should be reevaluated. As it is currently written the board has set a limit on the amount of hours a student should be spending per week on homework, however she stated that the policy isn\u2019t always applicable to all classes or students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe homework policy is really tough, I think we have some thinking to do about what really should be the policy,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI don't think a hard cap on minutes works in an environment where students complete work differently. Results have not been brought back to the board and It's hard for teachers to use the policy as it currently is.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental health and wellness has always been a vital topic in the Palo Alto community, and Caswell expressed her search for an improved system of assistance while acknowledging\u00a0the district\u2019s limitations.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur mission is education of our students and we will never be excellent mental health service providers,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cI look for new models in our community, I am looking to Stanford and other experts. This is a regional issue, state issue and we should work together with our colleagues in the city and state wide.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nIn light of recent events at Palo Alto High School, student journalists brought to light questions regarding the behavioral conduct among students and teachers. Caswell repeatedly emphasized the importance of an accessible and understandable policy.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt [sexual assault] is incredibly serious and we need to make sure what policy is written down is clear and understandable,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cIf everyone understands expectations then it's clear when they've been crossed. It is important that our teachers can be supportive of our students.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nTake a look at an introduction to the other candidates and their stances on various issues currently faced by the community, as expressed during the\u00a0forum.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/school-board-candidates-vie-for-three-opening-seats\/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of all candidates<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/guide-to-school-board-elections-jay-blas-jacob-cabrera\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jay Blas Jacob Cabrera<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/22\/guide-to-school-board-elections-todd-collins\/\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Collins<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-jennifer-dibrienza\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer DiBrienza<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-heidi-emberling\/\" target=\"_blank\">Heidi Emberling<\/a><\/span>","excerpt":"Melissa Baten Caswell, a current school board member, is running for her third term.

He expressed the need for relevant life skills and aims to create an educational system that caters to the unique qualities of each individual student.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSchools should be cultural epicenters of innovation,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cWe should be empowering our youth, and getting youth engaged in society early, transforming the way they interact.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabrera\u2019s innovative ideas include integration between elementary and secondary\u00a0schools. In addition, he says he believes core class sizes ideally should not exceed 20 students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIntegration between elementary, middle and high schools of multiple different ages and types of education in the same space is healthy and a new dynamic,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cClass size matters a lot, it should be under 20 students. University style lectures in the high schools where they then break out into smaller groups could be effective.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though he said he wishes to reduce class sizes overall, Cabrera strayed\u00a0away from providing a hard cap on the number of students enrolled in a class.<\/span>\r\n\r\nOver the past few years student complaints have increased in regards to the amount of homework assigned at the secondary level. In addition parents and students have brought up the issue of \"test stacking\". Many students have multiple tests in core subjects on the same day and sitting through two or three consecutive 90 minute blocks of testing can be grueling.\r\n\r\nCabrera believes that to solve the homework and test staking problem in the school district, it is necessary to have at least one year of research and collection of data on the specific topics mentioned above.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I wouldn't be comfortable [discussing solutions] until talking to students and teachers,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cMy interaction with students has been that homework is increasing, and we should reduce in general the amount of homework for free time with families.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Cabrera, although mental health is one of the most prominent issues in the community, there is yet to be a solution.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe need to be preemptively active in solving our issues, we need to recognize that we don't have the solutions,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cThe real issues are the societal pressures.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nTake a look at an introduction to the other candidates and their stances on various issues currently faced by the community, as expressed during the\u00a0forum.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/school-board-candidates-vie-for-three-opening-seats\/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of all candidates<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/29\/guide-to-school-board-elections-melissa-baten-caswell\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melissa Baten Caswell<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/22\/guide-to-school-board-elections-todd-collins\/\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Collins<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-jennifer-dibrienza\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer DiBrienza<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/21\/guide-to-school-board-elections-heidi-emberling\/\" target=\"_blank\">Heidi Emberling<\/a><\/span>","excerpt":"Cabrera Jay Blas Jacob Cabrera, a community organizer, is one of five candidates for the upcoming school board election.

He hasn't looked back since.\r\n\r\n\"My parents did that first race with me, but after that I was on my own and just enjoyed running.\" Slaney said. \"I did it whenever I could.\"\r\n\r\nAs a freshman, Kent Slaney broke three season\u00a0records, landing him in the top 50 running times. As a sophomore, he broke two, and another in junior year at the Lowell invitational. If one were to look at his stats, they would see consistent broken personal records at nearly\u00a0every cross country meet.\r\n\r\nCross country has a unique point system. The five fastest runners from each team to cross the finish line receive the points that correspond to their place. The first place runner receives one point, the second place runner two, and so on. The team receiving the lowest score wins, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cougarsxc.com\/Info\/how_to_score_xc.html\">Capo Valley's Cross Country guide.<\/a>\r\n\r\nKent recounts the latest\u00a0invitational and remarks on the teams performance as a whole.\r\n\r\n\"So far it's been\u00a0pretty\u00a0spectacular, both as a team and individually,\" Slaney said. \"At [the] Lowell [Invitational] we did great as a team. We got 41 points, and the next best team got 91. Also, in our first scrimmage with Gunn [High School], I broke a course record by 11 seconds. Looks like it's going to be a really great season,\" Slaney said.\r\n\r\nEach meet has its own set of records from past competitors. Slaney broke a course record for a meet against Gunn, with a time of\u00a010:13 on a 2.2 mile course. Most recently, he has bested his past miles times with his new personal record of 4 minutes and 16.63 seconds, according to his\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.athletic.net\/CrossCountry\/Athlete.aspx?AID=6003909#\/L0\">CA Cross Country Profile.<\/a>\r\n\r\nBut Slaney is more than just a cross country star; he aspires to pursue a career in STEM.\r\n\r\n\"I want to major in computer science or electrical engineering,\" Slaney said. \"I enjoy programming a lot, I'd enjoy going into that field. I'm also looking into recruitment options, and have been balancing running with academics.\"\r\n\r\nKent encourages everyone to give running a try.\r\n\r\n\"Running is something that when you put your effort into it, you enjoy it so much.

Among them were high performing members\u00a0of the team, such as senior quarterback Jordan Schilling.\r\n\r\nJunior running backs Paul Jackson III and Sione Latu were\u00a0crucial for Paly's\u00a0success, each scoring two\u00a0touchdowns and providing consistent\u00a0offensive pressure throughout the game.\r\n\r\nJackson III said that the Vikings' hard-working offensive line propelled the team to victory.\r\n\r\n\"I had so much confidence in them [the offensive line] today,\" Jackson said. \"They've been working hard all week and I may not always play the best but they definitely\u00a0are the stars.\"\r\n\r\nViking assistant coach Jack\u00a0Schweitzer said the team would be focusing\u00a0on executing the fundamentals and on avoiding costly errors.\r\n\r\n\"To be honest we wanted to play a really clean game,\" Schweitzer said. \"We wanted to play mistake free and for us it was executing what our base offense was and just getting back to some of what we like to do.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Schweitzer, although many excellent Vikings were injured, getting some of the less-experienced players out on the field will only benefit the team overall.\r\n\r\n\"It's kind of clich\u00e9, but it's like next man up,\" Schweitzer said. \"It's unfortunate that we have some guys injured, but the nice thing is that a lot of these guys that are injured we expect to have back so getting some other guys playing time should only help us in the long run.\"\r\n\r\nDespite a strong offensive showing, the\u00a0Vikings struggled to keep possession of the football, accumulating six turnovers over the course of the game.\r\n\r\n\"At times we were successful, but obviously we turned the ball over six times, we didn't do exactly what we wanted all the time,\" Schweitzer said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Schweitzer,\u00a0the team will avoid possession mistakes by adjusting their mental game.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of the turnovers are just a mindset problem,\" Schweitzer\u00a0said. \"It's just putting it [keeping possession] in these guys' [the offense's] heads and emphasizing it every day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings look\u00a0to take home another victory in two weeks against Saratoga High School at Paly.","excerpt":"A solid running game combined with fierce offensive pressure allowed the Palo Alto High School football team (2-3, 1-0) to make up for the absence of key players and to defeat the Santa Clara High School Bruins (2-3, 0-1), 44-31, Friday night at the Viking Stadium.","date":"2016-09-25 12:22:41","author":"William Sallomi","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/PJIII-Photo.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports","Sports Recap","Spotlight"],"tags":["football","paul","paul jackson","paul jackson iii","recap","sports"]},{"id":122730,"title":"Online homework becomes an official part of math curriculums","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/09\/24\/online-homework-becomes-an-official-part-of-math-curriculums\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algebra 2\u00a0and Intro to Analysis and Calculus teachers are <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">making\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mathxlforschool.com\/home_school.htm\">MathXL for school<\/a>, an online math homework program, an official part of their curriculum for the 2016-17 school year.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAfter running MathXL as a pilot program last year, math teacher Sharla May advocated for the program to replace normal homework.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_122765\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"429\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/IMG_6460-1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-122765\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/IMG_6460-1.jpg\" alt=\"Junior Claire Lin completes her math homework on MathXLForSchool during flex.

Photo by: Daniella Maydan[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLast fall, I asked if I could pilot the use of MathXL in my Algebra 2, and by second semester, math teacher Natalie\u00a0Docktor and I were both interested in expanding the pilot to our IAC classes,\u201d May said. \u201cMathXL for School is now the official homework platform for all Algebra 2 and IAC classes this year. Ideally, students work the problems on paper, as they would if they copied the problems from the book. The difference is that they submit their answers online to check, rather than turn in the paper.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Docktor, students are given three tries to get a problem correct. There is also the option to use up one of their three tries to view the correct way to solve a problem. After each incorrect try, the program shows step-by-step instructions on how the student should have solved the problem.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While students must complete all of the assigned problems, they only have to get 80 percent of the questions correct for them to receive full credit for the assignment. Additionally, \u00a0If students receive less than 80 percent, they can choose to do additional problems until their percent accuracy rises to 80 percent, meaning that it is always possible for students to receive full credit on their homework assignments, according to May.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to May, a big advantage to completing homework through MathXL is that the program provides instant feedback.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTraditional homework is scored based on completeness and the accuracy of two problems, and the turnaround for feedback was about two class periods, on average,\u201d May said. \u201cUnlike traditionally scored homework assignments, each problem in MathXL is scored as it is submitted and feedback about errors is also given. Another pro is that it is directly correlated to the textbook,\u00a0and since it is produced by the textbook\u2019s publisher, the problems mirror the exercises in the book.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nJunior Alexander Juncosa appreciates the convenience of using MathXL instead of paper homework.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI like this a lot more because it is convenient that you can access your homework at any time or place, just as long as you have a computer,\" Juncosa said. \"This way, you can never lose your homework or forget it at home.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While junior Claire Lin prefers the on-paper homework to online homework, she appreciates the fact that MathXL provides students with example problems.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf I am stuck on a problem the program has similar example problems and they give you step-by-step instructions on how to solve them,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThe program\u2019s example problems are super helpful, especially if you aren\u2019t super strong on solving a particular type of problem.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite its upsides, May and many of the students favor certain aspects of the paper homework.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to May, the largest downside to MathXL is that there may be certain types of problems that are not given through MathXL. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNot every question in the textbook has an accompanying problem in the MathXL system, so some problems I may want to assign aren\u2019t available\u2014such problems would be used as warm-ups or in-class practice,\u201d May said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior Kelsey Lu finds that it is harder to learn when completing math problems online.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you are writing on paper, it enforces organization,\" Lu said. \"It really helps when you want to take a step back. So if you don\u2019t understand what you are doing wrong, writing your homework on paper allows you to go back and look at all of your steps to figure out where you went wrong. I also prefer it when a teacher checks over my work, because on MathXLForSchool you can do something wrong but still get the correct answer and then you will never find out that you didn\u2019t understand the concept.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being made an official part of the Algebra 2 and IAC curriculums, May says that the program\u2019s effect on student performance is not yet clear.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLooking at data from some chapter tests, there did not seem to be a significant difference in test scores for students who used the textbook versus those who used MathXL in the IAC classes,\u201d May said. \u201cHowever, I did see a significant difference in my Algebra 2 students\u2019 test scores. \u00a0However, another variable in that Algebra 2 difference was whether the students did homework, or not. We will be able to make comparisons of last year versus this year\u2019s test scores from Ch. 2 on up.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"Algebra 2 and Intro to Analysis and Calculus are officially introducing MathXLForSchool, an online math homework program, into their curriculum.
